As far as I am concerned, however, the difference has almost disappeared. Whether people succeed or not depends on their skills using time and their professionalism.	In a dog-eat-dog society, it is more necessary to have the ability to compete with others in many areas such as studying, taking a job and marketing. In other words, the people of the modern society do need to have a skill to process their works faster than others do. As society is getting more intricate, people are getting busier. Therefore, the time is more important than before. In the past, people recognized time is just lapse or natural phenomenon, but now time is not only opportunity but also money; money is money. For example, in the automobile business, what is important is how many cars are sold in a certain time.	Today, our society requires professional persons with particular skills like doctors, professors, and computer engineers. Thus, a person who has professional and outstanding skills such as fixing, studying and analyzing will be successful in a modern society; it does not depend on whether the person is a woman or man, or his/her nationality. What is important is not whether the person is male or female but whether the one has superior skills than other irrespective of their culture. For example, in former days, it was common sense that women should stick indoors and do housework the whole day in Korea. However, nowadays, opportunities regarding studying and having a job are granted for women equally with men. It is also true in Europe, in America and even in the Middle East. Now, women are able to enjoy success irrespective of culture. Therefore, I think no more different expectations of success for male and female exist.",,0,0,0

Having a good family is the achievement for somebody else. For others, all the previous things and more is the meaning of success. In this paper I will write about my father's success, and what contributed most to his success: fate, hard work and intelligence. 	The first factor that contributed most to his success is fate. When he was fifteen years old he saw his father needed help in his work. I don't know exactly what the work is, but I think it was a gas station. Consequently, he started functioning with him while he was in high school. In that time his family was very poor, this caused him to work hard. After his graduation from high school, he started to employment in many different jobs, for example painter, woodworker and mason. Moreover, when he was seventeen years old he got permission to drive a car, and a truck, also. From the above you can see that he is a hard worker, too.	The other factor is his intelligence. When any problem happened with our family the first person they call is him, even if there are other people older than him.

Some successful people are well-known just in their country. For example, Mohammad Bin Abdalwahab was a successful person and he was a famous religious leader in Saudi Arabia. However, some successful people are popular in all the world, For example, John Kennedy was an important president in the U.S. In my opinion, my uncle is a successful person; he is a doctor and a specialist in Cancer disease.                In fact, he lived in a farm, and he worked there to assist his family. Because his father was a wise person, he sent him to a school to study. In that way, he finished his study in primary school, elementary school and secondary school in his village. Then, he traveled to another city in order to study in a university, so he entered the King Saud University in the college of medicine. After that, he had a great chance to complete his study in Canada in order to get a masterâ€™s degree and a PhD. So, he lived there for 6 years. By the end of this time, he went back to Saudi Arabia. As the result of his history, we know how he became a doctor.                Right now, he teaches in a university, and he works in an important hospital in Saudi Arabia. Also, he owns a clinic. However, he is always busy with his patients and he usually travels to communicate with different doctors and to attend many courses about his major to improve himself. In addition, people can see him on the medicine show in the channel of Saudi Arabia. In fact, working as a doctor takes a lot of work.                In summary, I think all the successful people have the same feeling and perseverance to achieve their dream; nevertheless, they each have different strategies to reach their goal.

128,6,en2,7779,"In Korea it is believed that the social success is important for males, while house work is important for females. First, males should not only work hard but also take care of their family. They also accumulate a fortune. For example, immediately upon graduating from the university, they went into business then they work till late at night. All living expensive is their share. They also spend their time with their family. When I was a child I only met my father at night. And we went to a trip almost every weekend.  Actually their final goal is to establish a company; although, in the majority of cases he is only an employee.  However, we should know money is necessary in our life, but money is not everything. Second, Males take care of their family that is more important than money. Specially, males earned a lot of money, but theyâ€™re unhappy since males only work hard. On the other hand, females are required to do housework, take care of their family and also support their husband. In my case, my mother always stayed with me when I was a child. In addition, she enjoyed cooking, so she tried to cook special food. Third, males should get leadership and be out going. And also there are important both relationship and friendship in business. They lead an audience. Furthermore, they are held in respect by an audience. In my case, my father have been own company since I was a child. He liked meet their friend, so we had many family meeting. On the other hand, females should keep modest and quiet and, at the same time support their husband.  To illustrate, females canâ€™t participate when they go to meetings. They take care of children and take between females.

Definitely, going to classroom and learning knowledge is necessary for everyone. It helps us to create general ideas of this world. However, the world changes every second. Thus, I believe there are some reasons to say that learning from real experience is more important than from classrooms.First of all, we can only get rudimentary information in the classroom, but we should go outside to practice how to do more. For instance, in the English speaking class, we study some polite way or formal way to communicate with native speaker. But in the real world, people sometimes change their talking style a lot. As in Pittsburgh, usually people use â€œwhatâ€™s upâ€ù or â€œhowâ€™s goingâ€ù to replace â€œhow are you.â€ù In fact, we have never learned â€œhowâ€™s goingâ€ù in the classroom. However, it makes people closer.Another importance is that even though we learn some ideal information from books, itâ€™s not always fit the true world. For example, many people learn how to cook from books, television, or cooking class. We have lots of instructions for cooking. Actually, there are too many variables which may affect your food such as personal taste, temperature, different brand of flavor etc. Thus, follow books not always refers to making a delicious food. Instead, it depends more on experience. In my opinion, because we need to learn more from the real world, and to adjust our knowledge to fit the reality, we should not only depend on studying in the classroom. In the contrast, going outside to get more experience will be a better choice.",,0,0,0

The restaurants politics is a food should be testy and looks beautiful, so people will buy it.  I believe that in a restaurant you cannot meet good quality food because they do it for a sale, so they do not care about how healthy their food is. In the other hand, when I cook dinner I always think what will be good for my husband and my children.The next aspect of my preference the family dinner is family conversation. Dinner time is the time to talk. During whole day the parents and the children do not see each other because of work and school, homework, TV, etc. The dinner is the place and time to talk, to ask how they doing, to learn something, and that important to teach children. For example, if you with family in big and fancy restaurant you not able to teach your children manners, how to behave. It is take lots of time to teach children.The last point is traditions.

Life need more than what you just learn from this class, these class just give you the keys to start in your life. Although the classrooms are important in your education, but it worth nothing without the personal experience.       Life need more than what you got from the classroom. You need to learn many other things outside the class, and you will not be successful without these important things. You need it in your social life and your profession life. For example the class doesnâ€™t teach how to make friends, doesnâ€™t teach you how to get involved in a deep relationship with person who going to share the rest of your life with. This in the social life, but what about in your work, you need to learn what it call experience this is one of the most important part when get in an interview job. I can see it in every advertisement about job opportunity in the newspapers. I think if you got something from the class, itâ€™s wonâ€™t be useful without the exercises.       Classrooms are not the most essential part in your education life in my opinion.

I would like to mention two qualities in my experience, such as a neighbor who is not very noisy, and who is able to clean their environment by themselves.	Fist of all, one of the qualities of a good neighbor is not to make a lot of noise, particularly at night. When I was a freshman, I moved to new house near my school because my school was very far from my familyâ€™s house. During first year in my college, I was living on first floor in my new house with one neighbor who was living on second floor in the same house.  My neighbor liked listening music, dancing as well. One of her hobbies was dancing with loud music. Every day after finishing school, she almost always practiced dancing with loud music. Otherwise, I like reading book, so I was very tired of it. One day, I complained about that, but she pretended to accept my opinion. And she continued dancing. 	The other quality is cleanness. Unfortunately, she was not used to cleaning her house. She always piled up her trash in her garbage. She didnâ€™t care the smell, and some insects from the trash. Sometimes, I tried to clean some of them when I threw my trash. After a while, I thought that it was better to move to the other house. Hopefully, my contract of the house was almost finishing.Although I have lived with a bad neighbor once, I realized a big instruction from the experience which is that I have to consider of neighbors more carefully than appearance of houses when I look for new house.",,0,0,0

There must be a lot of things you love there. Therefore, having food at home can make you feel relaxed and comfortable. However, to eat food, you have to cook. If you like cooking, it will not be a big problem. If you do not, it will kind of troublesome to you. One of the reasons I do not like eating at home is this cooking. If you are starving, you cannot eat food soon because you have to prepare it. It might be quite long time to get food. It might make you feel disappointed.

161,6,bz9,7816,"The expectations of women and men and their roles within society has always been an ongoing topic of debate amongst many cultures. Usually these discussions have favoured men over women and resulted in political movements, such as the suffragette movement in England.As a Muslim, I believe that God created man and women equal to one another and to complete each other. There is but minor differences between the two, yet these differences do not under any circumstances question their status.My native country is Saudi Arabia. Almost all Saudis are Muslims. And so the country and its people try to guide their life according to the teachings of the Quran. This teaches of respect and equality to everyone. A persons gender is second after the persons being as a human. And so before god we are all humans. Not males or females, just humans. And hence the Islamic belief is that every man and women has the duty to work hard and is expected to succeed in whatever path they have chosen to take.However Saudi is facing many problems with regard to equality amongst men and women and so many people question its existence as an Islamic state. With my stay in the USA I realised this difference more. Saudi cultural life segregates male and female life. Education, work, and other daily interactions always separate male and female interaction. Both girls and boys are encouraged to grow up with a solid education. However since employment in the female sector is limited, men are seen as the bread winners of the family. Islam teaches that a man must always be there for his family and so Saudi culture frowns upon men who do not support their families, both physical and emotional support. Women usually take up the role of the housewife and so she stays at home to be able to mother her children. And so as we can see male and female roles differ amongst Saudi culture. However with their role differences, both genders are expected to succeed in their lives with hard work. It is only when a role change occurs that peoples expectations of success begin to fall. So for example when women see men cooking and looking after the kids their expectations of having a delicious meal and tidy, clean children doing their homework is low. And vice versa.Saudi culture however is seen as a traditional culture. And many people in the US see it as dated. The USA is known for its freedom and liberty and so men and women are liberated. The US system of equality amongst men and women is actually very much like the equality values of my Islamic faith. And so men and women arenâ€™t segregated with role duties.

Iâ€™m Ceren Atasoy. Iâ€™m from Turkey. I built this website to introduce myself to you. I am an English-Turkish translator. Iâ€™ve just graduated from university on 2005. Since I am a freelance translator I enjoy my job a lot. The best part of being a freelancer is that I donâ€™t have a boss. I just accept the translations which I want to do and I refuse to accept others. I can translate everywhere as long as I have a computer to work on.              Now Iâ€™m in Pittsburgh to improve my English. Itâ€™s my forth time in Pittsburgh. My sister has been doing her residency in internal medicine in UPMC for more than 2 years. I usually come to visit her, almost twice a year. She has adopted two cats which are brothers and I enjoy being with them when she is in hospital. Actually I have 2 dogs in my country. I love animals a lot. Iâ€™ve always had pets at home since my childhood. Just the sight of them makes me very happy!              Swimming is my favorite sport. I always go to swimming including winter. When I swim I get rid of my problems more easily just like Iâ€™m leaving my worries in the water. There is nothing in the word that makes me more comfortable. I also enjoy walking by listening music. It makes me relax.             I like listening music everywhere. I think music is the only food for the soul.Reading a book takes me to a different world.  It helps me to leave the reality.                         The other things Iâ€™d like to sometime in the future are sky diving and underwater diving.                          Itâ€™s all about me for now.

433,48,fn2,8642,"If I asked American about what the most popular sport is in the U.S., my question would be considered very absurd. There is no room for doubt that football is the most popular sport in the U.S. Why is it so popular? From foreignerâ€™s view point, football seems to be too simple to be crazy for. Besides, there are few countries enjoying it as much as the U.S. I think there are three reasons. First, it is related to the vast territory. Second, it is influenced by the early history. And third, it is peculiar to the U.S.     The U.S. has vast territory. When the pioneers had settled down, there was an immense land belonging to nobody. I heard they had occupied their own land through running as far as possible and flagging the land. The last part of the movie â€œFar and awayâ€ù flashed across my mind. A big crowd was driving their carriages to all directions. Where they stopped, there became their own land. The rule is very similar to that of football. The further the players run, the more points the team gains. Those kinds of game could be possible only in vast territory.     I think football is closely connected with the early history of the U.S. There were many foreign countries in Europe having tried to occupy and dominate the U.S. There were many wars to be happened for the purpose of taking larger possessions. Sometimes wars broke out between foreign countries, sometimes foreign countries versus the U.S., and sometimes within the U.S. Conceptually, the way to play football reflects the history very much.       Football is one of the most popular sports. For example, the most expensive advertisement in the world is the TV spot of Super bowl. It means the most people watch the game. Nevertheless, it is mostly enjoyed by the American. Some countries enjoy rugby, but itâ€™s different from football. They love football passionately because it is their peculiar sport. Many Americans donâ€™t care much about any other countries and any other culture. They might think they are the center of the world. The uniqueness of football might symbolize the Americansâ€™ view of the world.      Americans seem that they really go crazy for Football. I think it is because it has some cultural and historical meaning. To understand it may be the best way understanding Americans and the U.S culture.

Traditional customs of marriage are very complex, but some customs have interesting meanings. For instance, most brides eat a longan before they marry a man, a newly wedded couple eats stick rice balls when they arrive at their new house and when they exchange a wedding ring they usually bend their fingers. Elders believe that a bride eating a longan before marrying a man means that she eats her husbandâ€™s eyes, so her husband canâ€™t see other women after they marry. Elders feel when a newly wedded couple moves into their new house means they will start a whole new life, so the eating stick rice balls means their life will come to perfection. Elders think when a newly wedded couple exchanges a wedding band in a wedding ceremony, they usually bend their fingers. A wedding ring means binding. If she or he let their partner put a ring quickly and directly in their wedding finger means â€˜You can control me easyâ€™. Elders always ask a newly wedded couple to obey all tradition wedding customs. However, young people always think that they love each other, and love makes everything are perfect.",,0,0,0

For example, the Roseâ€™s Gaint Boutique and Heartland Department are move to the Town Mall; and Shankâ€™s Menâ€™s Clothing Stores moves to the Town Mall in the suburbs.

Built on the land between the confluence of the Allegheny, Ohio and Monongahela rivers and the surrounding hills, Pittsburgh features a skyline of skyscrapers and dozens of bridges. Once an industrial center, the collapse of the United States steel industry has had a lasting impact on Pittsburgh. However, in 2005 in The Economist, Pittsburgh shared with Cleveland the top spot for liveable cities in the United States, and tied for 26th on cities world-wide. Despite these rankings, Pittsburgh still faces many problems common to Rust Belt cities. An overarching trend of declining population in the city has had multiple side effects, from a dwindling tax base to cuts in both police and firefighting services. In response to the collapse of the steel industry, Pittsburgh has become a nationally known center of medicine, education, technology and financial services.Finally, Pittsburgh's crime rate is significantly lower than other American cities.

Generally speaking, Taiwan aboriginals believe in pantheism, it means that they believe everything has a spirit.  For example, mountains have spirits, so they would worship mountain spirits if they want to have a successful hunting.  In addition, they also worship their ancestors because they are grateful ancestorsâ€™ contributions.  This faith is like Chinese tradition because Chinese also worship their ancestors.

568,48,dl5,8786,"RCS: chapter 6REASONS TO GO COLLEGE                 Colleges and universities are places where students can learn more and can gain new knowledge and experience.  Why do most people attend colleges? Different people have different answers to this question.  However, there are many people who want to go to a university or a college every year and they decide to do so for many reasons.  I believe that they attend because they are preparing for their futures.  There are three common reasons: (1) to prepare for a career (2) to increase their overall knowledge (3) and to get new experience.                Higher education is a necessary step for any person who wants to start a career in any major or area, especially nowadays.  It is very important for young people to attend college or university and receive a formal degree. If they do not have a good educational background, they will not have get a good opportunity to begin a career or even perhaps find a job.  Finding a good job is becoming more difficult day by day because the population and technology in the world have  increased so quickly.  So colleges and universities can provide students the new skills to meet the requirements of a career in this competitive world.                 Also, students attending a university or a college can increase their knowledge in subjects they are interested in.  For many people this is perhaps the primary reason to go to college.  There are many excellent professors and experts who can give plenty of knowledge across many subjects.  For many people this may be another source of knowledge in addition to what they have learned from their families. This extra knowledge from a university or a college will be very useful for life and employment. Attending college or university produces a well-rounded person.               Other people want to go to college or university because they decide to live a new, different, and exciting life.  For example, meeting new people and spending time at university activities will be new experiences for college students. Some students go far from their families and some even go abroad to another culture totally different from their native countries. Universities can support young people in an environment where the students can communicate and discuss many topics such as literature, the goals of life, art and emotions which may have been difficult to discuss in their pre-university lives. So it is a special experience for young people to live and to study in a college or a university.                          In conclusion, there are several reasons to attend college or university.  However, I chose to attend college to increase my knowledge and to get a special experience that will better prepare me for a career. Career advancement partly depends on your knowledge and your experience in different stages of life. College can provide this wealth of knowledge and experience.",,0,0,0

572,48,az4,8788,"The way of grading students differs from one place to another, sometimes from one professor to another. Grading affects the students a lot. Thatâ€™s why it's important to know how your professor grades your work at the beginning of the term. Either he grades on exam only or both on exam and participation. Some professors think that grading students on the exams only is the best way for grading; others think that participation is important, too. I think that dividing the grades into exams and participation is the best way. It gives the students the opportunity to get good grades, they will be relaxed, and it will encourage them to search for extra information.By grading the students by their exams and participation, the professor will give the students more chance to get good grades. However, participating in class will help the students in their lives a lot, they will be more confident when they graduate. Dividing the grades is better for the students, because if they fail in one test they can make-up in the other tests.The second reason which I think dividing grades between two things is better is that it will let the students more comfortable. Since they know that they have to study every day, but at the same time they will not be stressed about a final exam. Therefore, they will study more and they will gain more knowledge. 	To have more information about a certain subject and to know how to discuss it in front of others, which is difficult for some people, is one of the reasons why participation is important. Participation will help the students to talk in front of others even if it is difficult, but they have to since they will get grades on it.From my own experience, I think that participation is important. When I take classes with a professor who divides the grades, I usually get a higher grade than the subjects in which the professor depends on the exams only. I feel that I understand the subject very well because I have to study every day and I have to prepare the lesson to participate with the professor.    Finally, I think that grading students by exams and participation is more effective for them. It will help them to get good grades and it will be one of the reasons why they will love the course. They will be more comfortable while studying. The last thing is that the student will benefit from this way of grading by knowing how to talk in front of others without difficulty.",,0,0,0

The first alteration we know in his chronicle is that some famous and popular stores such as Poseâ€™s Giant Boutique mall, Heartland Department Store, Chandler Theater, and Chez Pierre restaurant have closed or moved out to other cities. Instead of those stores are some low level stores like a pawnshop, an â€œadultâ€ù movie theater and a pornographic bookstore. Also, the quantities of destroyed and dilapidated buildings are increasing in there. Some of them have graffiti such as â€œthe killersâ€ù painted on their walls, or have been destroyed by fire. Furthermore, the windows of the old buildings were shattered by stones. Finally, the shape of the main streets can present that the city government hasnâ€™t established good policies for their citizens. In the case of Decasia, there are more than forty potholes on the Main Street and the bus service has been discontinued. Both examples indicate that the city government has had some problems and obstructions in promoting the cityâ€™s policies, and they canâ€™t solve them.",,0,0,0

643,48,fx9,9073,"Good Effects of Onsen	Have you heard of the word â€œonsenâ€ù? â€œOnâ€ù is hot, and â€œsenâ€ù is springs in Japanese, so â€œonsenâ€ù means hot springs. In Japan, there are a lot of onsens, and people really love them. Soaking in a hot bath, not just taking a shower, is a traditional custom in Japan. The reason why Japanese people love onsen is not that they just like keeping their bodies clean. Onsen appears to make people feel good, relaxed, and refreshed. That is why people seem eager for it. Onsen brings good effects for your health: physically and mentally. Although the effects are still controversial, some experts maintain the idea.	Onsen seems to cause good effects on your health physically. If you soak in onsen, you get the influence of heat, buoyancy, and water pressure. That could make your circulatory, nervous, musculoskeletal, and hormonal systems work right. In addition, onsen has effects from minerals that are one of onsen constituents. The examples of minerals are sulfur, copper, iron, magnesium, calcium, or carbonate and so on. If you soak an onsen, the minerals will be absorbed through your skin into your body. If you drink it, they will be absorbed through your stomach and intestines and lead to good effects on your visceral system. Although the effects depend on what mineral the onsen contains, there are some general, common effects that are good for tiredness, sore muscles, stiffness, joint pain, and mild skin trouble and so on.	  Next, onsen has good effects on your mental health. Onsen usually has spacious bath and broad bathtubs that may be different from yours. In addition to that, the environments of onsen bring you unconstrained feelings because you are away from your usual life and could forget your stressful life, job, or problems even though it is temporary. Also, you may be able to relieve your tiredness, regain your energy, and refresh yourself because of onsen itself and the environments. Feeling comfortable may be the biggest reason why Japanese people love and use onsen from the old days.	    Onsen brings you good effects on both your physical and mental health. The physical effects need more research to prove the reliability because they are still disputable. However, from my own experience, onsen makes people relax. I believe it must have good effects on peopleâ€™s mental health in some ways, and many people have this comfortable feeling brought by onsen effects in the same way as me. Although I hope the effects will be proven scientifically, I think they have already been demonstrated empirically. Therefore, if you have an opportunity to have onsen, just try it. If you believe the effects or not, you can enjoy onsen.",,0,0,0

Similarly, Muslims have a lot of beliefs which require them to do some rituals. One of the most important rituals to Muslims, which is the third pillar of the five Islamic pillars, is fasting Ramadan. It is the ninth month of our Islamic Lunar calendar. It is the holiest month because we believe that the holy Qur'an was sent down in it. Therefore, Muslims are obliged to fast Ramadan, which has a lot of rituals and activities to do, a lot of benefits to gain and it has a special traditional taste to Muslims. In order to obey god, we fast during our holiest month, which is Ramadan. To fast this month, we are obliged t not eat, drink, chew gum, smoke and have any sexual contact during the day while it is light.  Therefore, our first meal, which is a breakfast, is after sunset. After that, our last meal, which is called Alsuhoor, is in the dawn before the sun rises.  Our fasting is not limited to the physical abstaining. In fact, in order to gain the whole boon, a lot of benefactions, blessing, and lose sins, we are strongly encouraged to give up the bad behaviors, such as swearing, lying, slandering, and gossiping.  We are encouraged to do a lot of good actions. One of those is giving charity. We are also urged to read the whole holy Qur'an during this month. For instance, some people read one chapter every day because the Qur'an is divided into 30 chapters. Doing a lot of praying is also encouraged in this month, especially during Laylat Ul-qader - night of destiny.  It is the night of the 23rd of  Ramadan. Others say it is in the last ten days of Ramadan, but it is mysterious. It depends on your sect beliefs. Anyway, it is the holiest night in Ramadan because the Qur'an was first revealed to prophet Mohammed through the angel Gabriel. As a consequence, we are urged to do a lot of praying during this night. In the Qur'an, it is stated that praying during this night is better than thousands of years praying. Finally, after Ramadan, in the first day of Eid Al-fter we are obliged to give charity. Observing Ramadan has a lot benefits, such as humanitarian, spiritual, and health benefits. First of all, we fast from sunrise to the sunset, which means we have to be disciplined. Thus, fasting teaches us how to be self-disciplined. In addition, it is a long period of time where we need to endure hunger and thirst. As a result, it teaches us self-restraint, and it reminds us of the poor people who cannot afford their food. Thus and Because of the urgency of giving charity, it teaches you generosity. Moreover, Fasting is a great experience, which takes you to the profound spirituality. It makes us feel the spirituality of obeying god and be more mind conscious. For instance, it makes your brain more awareness and makes you devise new ideas better. Fasting has health benefits, too. It helps to cure many illnesses. For example, it helps to cure the digestive system diseases such as gastritis and indigestion. It also helps cure obesity and high blood pressure. Ramadan is a month which has a special traditional taste for Muslims.  Families usually cook special dishes in Ramadan, which they usually do not cook in other months. For example, we usually cook Harisa - a dish made up with wheat and beef, only during Ramadan. Many families usually gather and eat their breakfast together.  In addition, a lot of people contribute food to their relatives, neighbors, and to homeless people.

Movies industry becomes a big part from the media sector and it has good effects and bad effects. ""Hollywood"" has the biggest hand in this industry in world nowadays. One of the biggest problems that we can see in the movies industry is the misunderstanding or the lack of information from the movies producers. And the Arabian culture one of the cultures that have been misunderstood, especially fromâ€ù Hollywood"" producers as we can see in many a lot of Hollywood movies.       Hollywood and the lack of information can be observed in its product. What we can figure out about what Hollywood knows about the Arabian culture is that they don't have enough information about the culture. Mixing between the Arabian culture and the Indian culture is one of the evidence that shows the lack of information. I really wondered when I saw in some movies when they have a scene about the Middle East they play in the background Indian music for example, Although, there are no relationships between them. Additionally, when they represent the terrorism issues, I can see that Hollywood shows the whole Arabian people as criminals convicted as terrorism. Ignoring the facts that in every nation there are an extremist and good people who against that but Hollywood denies that. When they represent some of our traditions in wrong way it does reflect a bad image about our culture â€œTypically when we look at Muslims represented on the big screen or on the spot screen, we see that they have always been stereotyped. There are always Arabs with long beards, terrorists and women who are fully covered with Hijab and who do not speak English. Itâ€™s very negative and stereotypical."" Islam had been lampooned in movies, writings, and TV shows in the United States, including ""JAG,"" ""24,"" and Arnold Schwarzeneggerâ€™s ""True Lies.""(One of the Muslims movies makers)      How does Hollywood damage the Arabian culture? It's obviously that what Hollywood produce have effects; either it's good or bad. But in the Arabian culture case it's almost a bad effect, I can see it in everyday life. When Hollywood showed a person with an Arabian face always a bad guy, it will reflect in our life especially in the societies where Arabs are minority in.

But also Hollywood shouldn't destroy the others repetitions in order to satisfy their own viewers with breathtaking scenes.

667,48,dj0,9085,"There are many kinds of characteristics which are important for success in our life. I think we can have different opinions about the subject according to what people think success is, such as intelligent, honesty, concentration, a sense of humor, and diligence. Especially, concentration and having a sense of humor are the most important characteristics for success because those two characteristics benefit more easily than the others.   First, one of the most important characteristics is concentration. Actually, I have felt the importance of concentration since high school. When I was a high school student, I prepared for several kinds of math exams to enter university. The first time I took one math exam, I really concentrated well on that. For example, I could not think about anything except the exam while I was taking it. I also got a high grade on the exam. However, another day, I took a same exam again to improve my score.  At that time, I did not concentrate very well because I was sure I would get a better score than the first time. It was not right. Consequently, I got a lower grade on the second exam than the first time. I think this experience shows how concentration is important to be successful in our life.The other characteristic is a sense of humor. Some people might think that a sense of humor is not essential for success in their life.  However, I realized that a sense of humor is one of the most important characteristics when I worked on team projects with my company. In fact, since entering university, I have had a lot of team work. While I was working on one project, I had conflicts with my company several times because we had different opinions for the project. However, one of my friends has a sense of humor. She usually made us laugh through joking when we had some troubles. Surprisingly, after laughing, we usually forgot the troubles and could figure out good solutions. I think a sense of humor can help us create powerful energy to do something well. In addition, the energy will lead us to finish work successfully in our life.Although there are various characteristics needed for success in our life, those two characteristics have influenced me a lot. I also think I have gotten many benefits from them. If I need to concentrate on a particular subject, I can do well. However, it is sometimes hard for me, so I hope that I can concentrate well whenever I want. In addition, I am not used to having a sense of humor, so I am looking forward to being a person who has a lot of sense of humor.

685,48,fg8,9102,"The Effects of Watching moviesWith the development of society, people are quite busy in their jobs and studies. They must concentrate on their assignments the whole day. Many people like to watch movies after a busy day. Gradually, watching movies has become one of peoplesâ€™ main hobbies. Some people feel movies will make people be violent. A number of people, regardless of adults or children, might commit crimes by imitating the violent actions in movies. Some movies might scare children. However, the present movies are sorted into several categories according to audiencesâ€™ ages. This measure can protect children from watching the scary movies. Watching movies has a lot of advantages.  For most people, movies can make them relax, have more topics to talk with others, and get more knowledge or ideas. First, movies can make people relax. Nowadays, people are too busy to take a rest and feel relaxed entirely. They are usually under high pressure. After working, they can watch movies. It can help them to forget their jobs, relax, and be in a good mood. For example, when I feel under pressure, I like to watch the comedic movies. While I am watching this kind of movie, I donâ€™t think about my jobs, setbacks, and unhappiness. I just laugh at the plots of the movies. After laughing, I will be in good mood. Then, I have more energy to solve my problems, and to face the challenges. Besides, I can have more topics to talk with others from movies. If I watch the same movie with my friends, classmates or colleagues, and even strangers, I can discuss it with them. It can help me to make friends easily or to have good relationships with them due to the topics about movies. In addition, sometimes we are too busy to spend time with our families. I like to watch movies with my family because I have more opportunities to communicate with them. Also, we could share our opinions, ideas, and feelings about the movies with each other. In my family, I usually watch movies with my family on the weekends. We sit on the sofa and drink coffee or tea. After watching movies, we will talk about them; no matter whether they are good movies or not. Watching movies together makes me have close interactions with my family. In addition, I can learn some knowledge and new ideas from movies. Movies involve many different kinds of fields, such as computer science, technology, psychology, and so on. They might differ greatly from the fields that you are familiar with. You can learn the unfamiliar fields from a variety of movies. When you are comfortable watching movies, you also can acquire knowledge and new ideas much more easily. For instance, when I was a senior high school student, I was confused about the chronological historical events. My history teacher often showed us some movies which were related to the period. They helped me to understand the developments of the events according to the backgrounds that those movies described. I was very impressed by them, and I wouldnâ€™t forget them. Watching movies is a good way to get knowledge and ideas. In a word, movies can make our lives become colorful and rich. They can not only help us to learn and absorb different and various knowledge or ideas, but also bring us entertainment and make us relax. If we relax moderately, we will have more energy to face our difficulties. Furthermore, movies can help me to have more subjects to talk with other people. We can discuss our feelings and opinions of the movies. It can help me enhance relationship with others. Try to watch movies when you have free time. You will discover why watching movies is wonderful.",,0,0,0

But itâ€™s comforting to know the ones you love are always in your heart.â€ù said Carrie, who was a character acted by Sarah Jessica Parker in the famous HBO TV series, Sex and the City. Itâ€™s not easy to find our Mr. or Mrs. Right because there are too many variables, such as families, wealth, and habits. However, if we can choose the right partner, he or she may make our life more colorful. In my opinion, there are three important concepts we should realize to help us to choose our Mr. or Mrs. Right.First of all, everyone should acknowledge that menâ€™s brains are different from womenâ€™s, and then we can avoid some arguments. For instance, men consider things straighter then women do. Like in the shopping mall, men usually find what they want quickly and then finish their shopping. In contrast, women are usually attracted by discount and charming appearance. As the result, they spend more time and buy more commodities. This difference makes men and women complain to each other very easily. Thus, if we find our partnerâ€™s action is quite different from ours, it doesnâ€™t mean he or she is really the wrong person. Sometimes, itâ€™s only because that men and women have different behaviors. The second valuable idea is that we should never think little of religious power. Some religions do have a great power to change peopleâ€™s mind and let our right partner become a wrong one. In my case, I broke up with my ex-girlfriend just because of the religion problem. She has been participating in the Taiwan Zen Buddhist Association for more then four years, since one year after we met each other. Before that, we were almost perfectly suited. However, it had changed her thought a lot. One obvious example is that since we donâ€™t know what will happen in the future, I think we should do our best at the present moment in order not to be regretful. But in her opinion, we should practice moral teaching to turn something bad in the future into something good. Thatâ€™s the main reason why I couldnâ€™t communicate with her anymore.Finally, to have a soul mate as our Mr. or Mrs. Right is more significant than to get together with a roommate. We donâ€™t want our partner only to share casual or physical elements with us, such as how much salary we earn or how comfortable our house is. In the contrary, we need someone who can really share our spirit, our emotions, or our passion. Moreover, having a soul mate as our right partner will let us feel like a real couple, not just two individuals.Itâ€™s no doubt that everyone has his or her own standard of choosing Mr. or Mrs. Right. However, to realize differences between men and women first, not to ignore the effect of religion, and to find someone who can really share our mind are three important things in my thoughts. Perhaps try to live together for a while before marriage is a good way to figure out that our partner is suited or not, because it allows us to know each other more deeply.",,0,0,0

Retrieved September 10, 2006, from http://compreviews.about.com/cs/laptops/bb/aabyblaptops.htm         How to buy a notebook computer   Nowadays, notebook computers are popular. A notebook computer is considered portable personal computer. Sometimes it is called a laptop computer. In many cases, it may be a replacement for a desktop computer. There are many factors need to be considered when choosing a notebook computer. The key items you want to look at before you purchase your next notebook computer are size and weight, processor and display.   The first characteristic to look for in a notebook is its portability features. Those are its size and weight. The lighter one is more portable but sacrifices items such as a CD-ROM drive. The bigger and heaver one makes it difficult to carry around. Do not ignore the weight of accessories such as an AC adapter when carrying the notebook computer.   Another characteristic to look for before you choose the right notebook computer is its processor. In nowadays market, Intel and AMD are the two most famous manufacturers of computer processors. One of the main features of a processor is its clock speed in expressed in gigahertz (GHz). For normal computer use, above 1GHz processor is sufficient. On the other hand, at least 1.8GHz notebook computer is recommended in case to be a desktop replacement. Although the amount of memory (RAM) factor is important, it can be upgraded later.   In addition to the size of a notebook computer, display size affects its overall size. In other words, a bigger screen is better but it becomes more difficult to carry. Another factor is the screen quality. Display resolution describes the sharpness and clearness of an image stated as number of pixels that enables us to identify the different kinds of screens.   Although, there are many more factors when selecting a laptop, choosing the proper size and weight so you can carry it easily is one of the important ones. Moreover, selecting the right processor and right display are important too when choosing your next notebook computer.",,0,0,0

And how much time he will spend on his career sitting in front of the computer doing his job?	Some people have hobbies can also be a life career, but they couldnâ€™t choose it for a reason, such as their grad werenâ€™t good enough to be accepted to a major that related to their hobby, or their family want them to be a particular person with a particular field of a study that they pick, or their hobby hasnâ€™t a good career for their future, or it canâ€™t be related to a career. But what if a person who has a career that related to his hobby? or his hobby was his career, he will like his professional life, and he will be a satisfied about that life because he will have a good time working and not just that he will give a great result of his work. I had a friend who hadnâ€™t a good high school grad so he was going to go the architect school but he tried his best and somehow he went to it. What happened next to this guy he graduated from that school with a good grad? Now he has the life that he was dreaming about as a manager of an architecture company. Another example of a person who went to a medicine school just as his father wanted him to. After one year that person changed his field of study to something he loves to chemistry. Just as what he wanted to do. So, what if our hobby can also be a good professional life, how good our life can be? And how much we are going to love our life?	Hobbies can affect our life in appositive or a negative way. If we like to do a particular kind of sport and itâ€™s our hobby, for example swimming or playing soccer.  That lead us to be in good health, beside it keeps us in a good shape, when some has healthy body it helps him being good thinker. The negative result of being an addicted to your hobby if it unhealthy one. if we have a child who loves sitting in front of the video games for twenty four hours a day. for sure that affects  his mind and his health for that we need to organize and control the time we spend doing our hobbies, so it may not affect our health in a negative way.	After all, if we have a hobby with a good field of studying and a good professional life. Why donâ€™t we choose it to be our life? If we have unhealthy hobby, why donâ€™t we control our time to make the affects of it less? If we have a hobby how can we organize our time doing it? Hobbies affect our life and they take a big part of it, but how can we control our love of it?",,0,0,0

Body â€” the way of choosing a reasonable car1) Reason you buy a car (purpose) â€“ engine, size2) To consider the price â€“ budget3) Option â€“ use versus new4) Option â€“ whereIII. Conclusion â€“ should consider the situationIn a modern society, a car is one of the most indispensable things such as drinking water; most people want to have their own car because by having it, people can change their life efficiently and the life can be safer. For example, your children might be sick in the midnight when buses do not work or suddenly you could be hungry. Of course, even if there is no bus when you need to go to somewhere, you can call a taxi. However, you may not deny that the cost and time is more required on that case. If so, what is the perfect way to buy a car? Here is the best way.First of all, you must think that which kind of cars you need. In other words, you need to think about the purpose of purchasing a car; it might depend on your status. If youâ€™re a student, you want to go to school, to go to shopping, and even go to travel somewhere with your girl friend by your car. If so, you may buy a small sedan, a coupe, or a sports car having two doors. However, you should buy bigger one, if you are the head of family who has children. In that case, it is better to buy a jeep or a van. As for business man like a CEO, a high-class car might be needed because the car could express their or their companyâ€™s trust.Second, the price is also the essential point of buying a car. You must not buy an excessive car.  If you need an expensive car by all means, it might be better to consider used one. Another effective choice is to check the web site or a flea market. Perhaps, in the area, you can find the cheapest car in the U.S. Besides, by comparing the insurance companies, you can find high-quality coverage.Third, you need to examine specifications and features of the car you will buy. Engine displacement, transmission, the number of doors, and wheel are important factors as well. You should never forget to check the number of airbags and whether Anti-lock Brakes System is or not.To conclude, you should consider your situation before you buy a car. If you check above the 3 pointsâ€”aim, price, and spec, you can get a reasonable car easier; you never regret with that.",,0,0,0

786,73,gl6,9572,"How to Be Successful at the University	It is important to graduate from the university with high grades, because this will help you to get a good job you like, or will let you complete your studies as a graduate student. If you want to graduate with a high GPA, you should focus on these activities: exercising, managing your time and setting priorities.	Exercise is the most important thing. Spend an hour or half an hour a day or every other day in the gym, go jogging, go to the pool, or play other games such as table tennis. Keep yourself physically fit. This will improve your thinking by getting your blood flowing and bringing much-needed oxygen to the brain. This causes a boost of energy that's especially needed during exams. I know itâ€™s hard to do it, but instead of cramming 12 hours a day for 5 days during the finals, spend one hour each day at the gym. You will immediately feel the difference. You will not lose that hour because you will, in fact, be studying more productively the other 11 hours.	Time management is the best way to succeed. You need to choose where and when you study best. The excellent place for study is your room, but you have to keep it clean and arranged; this will keep you comfortable. Also, the best time to study is early in the morning, because your brain will be very active. Most likely, the worst way to study is in a group. You will spend most of the time talking and joking with each other. It is a waste of time. Out of two hours of study, you may only get 15 minutes of information going to your brain. In addition, separate your day time, time for exercise such as playing some sports, time for homework, time for close study such as studying old subjects and preparing for new lessons; time for fun such as watching TV or listening to the radio. 	Setting priorities are one of the most important things. You should always keep your goals in front of your eyes. And try to plan to reach these goals. For example, my goal is to graduate from the University of Pittsburgh. For this reason, I have planed to work on the TOEFL test while I'm studying the intensive English program. After that, I'll apply to the university on the summer semester. However, you might do this, take out a piece of paper and write the most important goal you want to accomplish, and then write the ways to reach this goal and the time needed to do so. In your bed every day, think about this. Also think about new plan ideas every day. I think you will soon achieve your goals.	In fact, it is a very easy thing to do toward a high GPA. It will not cost anything. However, there are some other points to remember. Get to know students a year ahead of you to ask about the professors and the courses. You need to study hard and attend all the classes. Donâ€™t come late and donâ€™t forget to do your homework. Manage your time and study well for the quizzes and tests. If you do so, in the final exams you will feel comfortable and you will do well. Also focus on the class notes more than the books. Finally, take classes you like; you will do better in classes you enjoy.",,0,0,0

Therefore, there are many ideas to help you to do this.	In fact, there are many ways to learn how to write an essay. The first way is taking some courses in writing. In this way, you can learn how to arrange your ideas with the information you have, and how to present this idea in clear sentences. In fact, I have been taking writing class for 2 semesters in order to prepare myself to academic study. The second way is the Internet, because the Internet has many websites that teach us writing. So, if you donâ€™t have enough money to take writing courses, or you donâ€™t have time to attend these classes, you might have a chance to learn by the Internet. So, I used to use this method before I came to the U.S to learn not just writing, but the English general , because it doesnâ€™t cost any thing, and I didnâ€™t have time to take a regular classes.	In addition, there are many ideas to develop your writing skill. For example, try to read in your free time. For instance, you can read newspapers, magazines and academic books. Also, you might write in a various type of writing such as a letter, a report or a short story. And, after you finish your writing you may revise it by yourself or ask your friend to do it for you. In that way, you will know your mistakes, so you can avoid them in the future. In fact, I always write my assignment of the writing class, then I often revise it by myself, after that I usually ask my friend to check it for me, so if I have mistakes I can correct them before I send this assignment to my teacher. You might do this process many times until you become satisfy about what you wrote.   	Overall, if you follow these steps you will success in the study life and in the work life.",,0,0,0

However, the majority of students donâ€™t know how to manage their time well and they often confuse that why they always havenâ€™t enough time to finish their homework, prepare for the test or enjoy their life at school.   Students can accomplish it if they learn these strategies, making good use of your time on the classes; having a reasonable schedule and carrying it out strictly.           The first and vital step is to make good use of time on the classes, paying most attention on the materials that your teachers teach and taking the notes to help you remember. The teachers are good guiders, they know what context will be hard for you to study, what part should be emphasized for you to grasp.  So they can find a good way to make you sense easily and quickly.  Concentrate on the materials, and take the notes, you can grasp all the new knowledge.  If you donâ€™t do, youâ€™ll both waste the time on the classes, and have to spend much more your spare time on studying them by yourself.  Sometimes, even if it takes you a long time to learn them and youâ€™re probably quite tired of them, but you still canâ€™t fully grasp all the materials that the teachers have taught.  Thatâ€™s the reason why many students are busy studying, but they canâ€™t study well.  Therefore, by making good use of time on the classes, you will find study isnâ€™t a difficult and boring work, and youâ€™d like to enjoy it.          Another step is to have a reasonable schedule and carry it out strictly.  This schedule includes that what period you should have to study, doing your homework, reviewing what you have learned and previewing what youâ€™re about to learn; what period you can have a rest, make friends and have fun.  You should divide your time in detail with these contexts and write them down.  When youâ€™ve finished one of these contexts, you should sign it. It will be helpful for you to carry out your plan strictly.             The task of students is not only to study the knowledge well, but also to fully enjoy the life at school.

Because it is a global word right now, we have many chances to talk with foreigners who are not use the same language as us.  As an English learner right now and I have had 10 years experience about learning English, I think there are several ways to be a successful language learner.  I think attending the language school, finding a native speaker to be your conversation partner, and keeping on practicing are the good ways to improve your language skill.		Attending language school is the most direct way to make your foreign language become better.  For example, if you want to learn Japanese, it will be good for you to attend the language school in Japan.  You will have a good learning environment there, and teachers there will give you the complete education about Japanese.  Thus how to choose a good language school is an important part of making your Japanese becomes better.  I think there are a lot of information about how to choose the good and suitable language school, itâ€™s good to gather this kind of information before choosing the language school.	The second way to become a successful language learner is to find a native speaker as your conversation partner.  I think some of the language learners have experiences about having conversation partners.  Having a conversation partner not only can help you practice your foreign language, but also can get some information about the foreign culture.  If we have conversation partner, we can improve our listening and speaking skill, especially I think the speaking skill is the hardest part for foreign learner to improve.  I strongly recommend finding a conversation partner if you want to make your foreign language just like your native language!		Besides those, you still need to keep on practicing the foreign language in any chance.  All kinds of language, if you donâ€™t use it often, you might forget it.  In order not to forget it, you should practice foreign language usually by yourself.  It will not only maintain your language skill, but also improve it.	Learning language successfully is not easy, because there are too many things need to be considered.  However, following the three ways above can make you become a good language learner.  If you still donâ€™t know how to learn language well, maybe you can try it now.",,0,0,0

You desired to possess a group of fish after you saw colorful and beautiful fish swimming in an aquarium. Unfortunately, when you bought all things and put them together with fish, the catastrophe gradually appeared. Although you, however, had made a maximum effort to sustain the fish, they still died. This is a normal typical of people breeding fish first time. Actually, it can be avoidable if we set up a good enviroment for fish by selecting coordinating fish, using correct materials, and adopting right procedures, not simply mixing the material together with fish in a tank.	First of all, choosing fish you want is the most important thing. Remember the natural rule --- big fish eat smaller fish. The fish in different size can not live together. Especially notice that some small fish you purchase are still baby at the time. You need to know how big they will be when they grow up. It is because they will kill all of the smaller fish when they grow big enough. If you do not know enough informatin about them, you could read the card in front of the selling tank or ask an employee.	Carefully choose the materials you will put into the aquarium for decoration. Some of them, except the artificial ornament, will release chemical substances into the water. The chemical substances will change the quality of the water. For example, if the sand used to cover the bottom of the tank comes from the ocean, such as it made of coral, it will release salt into the fresh water. Then the fresh water will become salty, and it can easily make some fish ill, whereas if you are setting up an aquarium for seafish, the sand is the best choice for it. Therefore, before you choose the materials, you could refer to the demonstration in the store or read the use directions.	Before you put fish into the tank, do not forget to provide a stable environment for the weak fish. It means that when you set up the equipment, put up all of the materials first, and after pouring water down 7 days later, then only can you put fish into the tank. The period will determine whether or not fish survive. Due to adding the good bacteria during the process of setting it up, they need some time to settle down. The good bacteria mainly decompose the fish waste and make the environment stabilized. Thus, you must be very patient until the bacteria start to work.	After buying appropriate materials, building up a stable environment, and choosing some species of fish which can live together in peace, you have a good start now. To maintain the good quality of the water you only need to change one-fourth of the water to fresh water every week afterwards. Controlling the quality of the water is as crucial as feeding food to fish. Pay attention to these. You can have a vivid and active water world.",,0,0,0

They have to consider at least these three things: entrance exam scores which they got tests, location of the college or university, and the tuition of the college or university.   First, they have to choose a college or university which fits with their scores. If the college is higher than their scores, they would not enter the college. For example, when one person got scores half of the whole scores, one wants to enter Harvard University, it is almost impossible to enter that. Therefore, they must select some colleges or universities which they are able to enter with their scores.   Second, not only their grades but also the location of the college is important. The environment also influences students and their studies. If the college is located next to factories or work areas, they would not concentrate on their studies and could get stress. There might be some people who like noisy environment, but quiet environment may be good at their study. Therefore, they have to choose a college or university which is located in more convenient or quiet place.   Third, this is important. If the collegeâ€™s tuition is very expensive, and the students canâ€™t pay, they canâ€™t go to that college. They have to choose a college which they can afford. If the tuition is expensive, they should have part-time jobs. Especially they have to work almost a day, they couldnâ€™t concentrate on their studies perfectly. That would prevent them from studying.

Iâ€™ll remind you how to keep your body healthy, because most of students know that this is important, but donâ€™t do that.	At first, you should expend your time to do exercise regularly. Health is the most important thing to achieve what you ant to do.  I know that many students are too busy to do exercise.

848,65,ah1,9846,"How to select a major	High school students finish high school when they are about 18-19 years old. Then some of them will go to study Bachelorâ€™s degree. They have to make a decision to select a major for studying in college or university. If you are a high school student who wants to select a major and wants to be successful in university, you can decide the major that you like, find information about your major and know the kinds of job and your major relate.	First, when the high school students want to choose a major which they will study with Bachelorâ€™s degree, they should know what they like. Because the major that they like will be more interesting than majors that they do not like, they will be interested in lessons and satisfied with their major. They have to determine their suitable major. That can help them to be successful in graduation because they can quickly and easily understand the lessons and solve the difficult problems. For instance, if you are a high school student who will graduate from high school next semester and you think that you like Mathematics and Physics and do not like Biology, then you can study engineering, computer sciences or sciences, but you should not study in medic. If you want to study medic, you may not be happy when you are learning, and you may want to change your major. That would be a waste of time and money.	In addition, you should know information about the majors which you want to choose or you are interested in. You can find a lot of information about majors from your teacher, universitiesâ€™ websites or your friends. The information can help you to select a major because you will know subjects which are in a curriculum. That can help you decide whether or not you like the major. You also can use a lot of information to compare majors that you want to select with another or compare with other universities. For example, if you have two or three majors which you like, you can find out about these majors. You know that there is one major which you have to study Biology which you do not like, thus you may not select this major.	Lastly, you should learn about jobs when you graduate from your major. It depends on cities, states, and countries because in some places, they may want more doctors or more engineers. For that reason, you should find information about job which you can use your ability and knowledge. If you can graduate from your major but you cannot find a job that you can do or you can find a job which you cannot use your knowledge from your major, you will not feel good or will not be successful in your life even though you can study in a major that you like. As an example, if you live in Thailand, there are too many buildings in Bangkok, thus we do not want to construct more buildings. Consequently, civil engineers in Bangkok may have a lot of trouble finding work. If you want to study in engineering and you are making a decision between civil engineering and computer engineering, if you know about this information, you may choose computer engineering as your major.	Finally, you can select your major which you like, you know its information and you know the kinds of job you can get when you finish your major. You can feel happy, enjoyable and pleasant when you are studying in university. If you confident to your determination, you can select a suitable major and will be a prosperous person in the future.",,0,0,0

856,65,fv6,9850,"The first short movie of the American director Maya Deren, â€œMeshes of the Afternoonâ€ù, left its mark in the history of American movies with a critical point of view of the Hollywood system, and established a new way to think of Cinema. This movie continued the work of French experimental cinema like â€œLe Sang dâ€™un PoÃ¨teâ€ù by Jean Cocteau, and participated in creating a new experimental movement. It also marks a transition between narrative classical movies and a new free cinema in its own creation and its connection with reality. Maya Deren opens a new direction with â€œMeshesâ€ù which represents a triple transition: in her personal life, in the movie itself and in the history of experimental cinema in United States. First, â€œMeshesâ€ù is a transition in the life of Maya Deren. She produced it in her own house in California with her husband, Alexander Hammid, in 1943. Before that, she studied in Europe and New York, and when she came back to the United States, she began working as an assistant to the famous dancer and choreographer, Katherine Dunham, who taught her voodoo rites. She also worked as a journalist, a poet and an anthropologist, and she was the first woman to win the Guggenheim prize to study voodoo in Haiti. When her father died, she received an inheritance with which she bought her first video camera, and which helped her to create her films without money problems. From then on, she learned to think and write in images with the help of Alexander, who was already a filmmaker in Europe before living in the United States. 	Secondly, the movie itself portrays a certain transition. We could see a young woman who comes into her house and sits down on a couch to sleep. She begins to have a nightmare in which she retraces the same path four times until breaking a mirror with a knife in order to destroy the reflection of her husband. One can see in this act Maya Derenâ€™s refusing sexual rules of western society, but also, with the final death, see the symbolic passage from one life to another one. The repetitive structure shows us a passage from death to rebirth. In other words, this movie shows the end of a preamble where the artist has found the best way to express her ideas. That is to say the death of the woman in this movie is a possible metaphor which represents a new direction on Maya Derenâ€™s life and work (before this movie she tried to express herself by writing, with the cinema she found the good way to express her ideas).  	Finally, this movie gave to Maya Deren a new way to think about cinema. Art pioneer in experimental filmmaking in the United States, she was both a film theorist and a filmmaker, and the reaction to her work allowed directors to see that an audience existed for this sort of movie. Before that, experimental movies were shown, most of the time, in art galleries and private houses in New York, Los Angeles, Paris and seldom at festivals and only for artists, filmmakers and rich people like Anais Nin (a rich woman who played and produced some of the experimental films in United States), but she decided to show them everywhere in the United States. Then she developed a new system to speak about her work and her theories. She was the first experimental filmmaker to propose a lecture in the universities. The first one was at the University of Syracuse in 1945. Strange though it may seem, this system of lecturing about her own work actually helped to promote the experimental cinema in general while helping to show that an audience existed as well as helping to develop cinematic theories. 	To conclude, even if this movie functioned as a catalyst to experimental cinema and seems like a rite of passage in the directorâ€™s life, we mustnâ€™t forget that she wasnâ€™t the only one to work for a new cinema. Some filmmakers like Kenneth Anger, Gregory Markopoulos and later, Jonas Mekas and Andy Warhol, tried to find a new way to express themselves, with new subjects, outside of Hollywood. Nevertheless, Maya Deren is still considered the â€œmotherâ€ù of Underground Cinema.",,0,0,0

859,65,ga3,9854,"How to Organize a Special Event	Event means a performance, sports competition, party because of some especially reasons or purposes. For example, a small party for a little child 8 years old birthday is a kind of event. A big competition such as a Dragon Boat Race also is an event. Some students who work on a club or group might need to prepare a ceremony for the new fresh students, so they need a principle to lead them. Some employees who work for a company might need to organize a special event for an annual ceremony. If we canâ€™t know the principles about how to organize it, that would face a challenges for organizerâ€™s abilities. We can control everything every well for an event based on these principles: gathering people, controlling the process, preparing objects and dealing with emergencies.	Gathering people is a function for the event because most of purpose of event is to build a brand for a company and let more people learn the products. First, we need to collect a group and decide who the speakers are and who the audiences are. Then we might remind the speakers about a concept of event, time of the event and place of the event. Donâ€™t forget confirming with them before hand. That is useful and helpful. For audiences, we might produce a letter of invitation to remind the audience to show in event, and we might make a reward for the attended audiences. 	If the process of the event is controlled, it indicates the organizer makes a great job. A schedule is an effective way to control everything.  We can write down most of things such as the boss, the assistant, and responsibilities for each person, etc. Do everything on time. An entire schedule would clarify what is the most important at different moment. Also, a useful schedule can help workers know what had gone and whatâ€™s going on. Some sheets will be wild and flexible way and we can use it in a variety of areas. For example, when we hold a ballet race, we need a sheet to organize an order of dancer. It helps the process of the race. When every one gets a sheet which includes their responsibility, we can work in easy way. Confirmations are also necessary.	Objects include equipment and materials that work as second foundation. Make a list which includes name, number, required and operator. That can clarify most details including some tiny features. Sometimes we need to predict a number of materials like preparing food in a ceremony. Ask somebody to help and avoid waste. Anything should finish before the event one night at least. If an emergency happened, we would have enough time to adopt. 	Emergencies can happen on any event, so we need some skills to deal with that. Nobody likes an emergency, but anyone should have alertness in our mind. Sometimes emergency will accompany us, so pay close attention into the whole process. Unfortunately, if an emergency happened, we would follow three principles. The first principle is to keep claim. Then, make sure people safety.  Think about an instead method to solve it. That needs to work on all of our intelligences and experiences. So experiences and relationship are very important factors at that time. For example, if a speaker was late, a good organizer would be able to find somebody instead them.	Organizing an event success is one of the most experiences in life like a new life made by ourselves. That makes our job or study wonderful. It might be difficult or easy, but we can enjoy it and lean more in that. That is a long way to lean all of the skills and practice is a best way to get it.",,0,0,0

Both of them have its advantages and disadvantages. So if they decide to stay with their parents they will feel safer with fewer responsibilities. But if they want to live separate out of their family they will become reliable on them self.    Live with parent have many advantages for young adult who donâ€™t use to live independently. Also, it has reward and punishment.  First, some of them donâ€™t want to have responsibilities toward home and family. Second, some of the young adults donâ€™t expend a lot of money while they live with the parents. For example, they wonâ€™t pay house rent if the house has rented, bill payment and food expenses. Furthermore, parents take care of all responsibilities and give their son or girl some advises will help them in their life. On other hand, live with parent have many disadvantages. There are some of them. First, independency a lot of the young adults feel they donâ€™t have right to live freely when they stay with their parents, or they can not decide in small thing as they think such as at what time they should come to house  . For example, if they come home at night late, their parents blame them, and may be they will punish them as well. Second, they have restraints in the house. They canâ€™t meet their friends at home so they have to go out and meet them at cafe shop, or restaurant, and discuss about their problems.To decide to live individual without parents and family is a big challenge for students, or worker who has the first step in his life out of his house and his family. It seems easy for person has no experience in the real life. When the young adults make a decision to separate out of family life and live their own life. It has many advantages and has disadvantages, too. The most advantage of living by themselves is learn how to mange their life well, and they can make own decision without help from any body. Young adults who live with their parents are less confident than people who live individuals. Second, they can develop their creative potential. For example, they can deal with difficult situation when they forced to it. On other hand, separate from family and what the person has habit is very hard and very difficult. Independency may sometime case many problems and has disadvantages. One of disadvantage is how can they earn money without experiences. For instance, in my country the biggest problem for people who want to separate from their family is they arenâ€™t qualify to do that because they used to depending on their parents in every thing until they get a job. One of the problem will face them are addiction on drugs, addiction on alcohols because Parents always advise their sons.Finally, to live alone or with the family it is depend on the young adult so there are some young adult can live by themselves and some are not. It is rely  on how they used to living . Live with family for long time is better than live alone independently because it has disadvantages will effect the person who arenâ€™t be eligible.",,0,0,0

896,65,dr5,9929,"How to be a good friend	Nobody can live without people supporting and being happy for him. These people called his friends, too. To have good friends you have to be a good friend. This means, you should treat your friends as you like to treat you. However, having good friends is simply focusing on you. If you deal with your friends by dour definitely they will deal with you as you deal with them. For instance, if you were saying bad things about your friends they will hate you, and then they are going to get far away from you. Furthermore, to be a good friend you should find out a way to their heart. To find out this way you should follow some wonderful rules. These rules are helping, advice and kindness. 	People always help each other to make their life easier than in the past. Inventions are the most proof of this fact. If people were not helping each other to create new invention they will not get better in their life. Anyway, helping your friends is one of the most common ways to get to their heart. Helping them is the evidence to make them believe about your honest. If somebody was in trouble you should try to solve that problem for them. For example, if one of them made an accident and they forgot to get insurance you should give them your hand to extract them from their situation and reduce their depression by helping them and loaning them some money. Do not leave them alone without giving them any help. In additional, you might give them some advice such as to get a new insurance in that situation or any advice on others situation. Guide them to the right way and make them feel comfortable toward you. Even if you do not how to solve that problem try you best to make them relax. As an example, if your friend had trouble with their car and they cannot fix it, you should try your best to fix that car. However, if you do not know how to fix that car, you might know another friend who can fix it, and they may do not know them. Giving advice to your friends is going to certain your relation and makes it stronger than in the past. 	 You should deal with your friends by amiable way and give your kindness. Do not hurt them by a strong action. For example, if they like to talk about sports try to talk with them about them. Even so, try to control yourself when you talk with them about your opinion and, definitely respect their opinion. Do not make any gaping between you and your friends by making a strong action. 	Being a good friend is your chance to make people remember you. However, each person has their way to gather people around them. Nobody can imagine how the friendship is nice only who do not live on this earth. The ways to a person's heart are helping, advice and kindness. To have good friends depends on you. However, your morals reflect your position, not appearance and not money can get people together with you. In fact, your morals are helping, advice and kindness.",,0,0,0

For example, which kind of subject do you like; Physics, Mathematics, Law, Art â€_etc. Second, ask your parents for their help and support. This kind of opportunity is not there for a lot of student. So, if one of your parents work in the special field he/she can give you a lot of information and the full pictures for his/her work.

948,74,fe5,10009,"Which major to choose; the Hobby or the Market!?	When you graduate from high school, you start to think about your future and which major to choose. Choosing the appropriate major is usually a huge and a difficult task for college students.  As a consequence, some students have specific criteria in which major to choose. Some might choose a major which the market needs, and it has a scarcity in the market; because they think that they can make lots of money quickly. Others might choose a major which is related to their interests and their hobbies. In my opinion, to accomplish many elements in your life, it is more important to choose a major that you like, rather than choosing a major based on the market.First of all, on of these elements, which is usually important for all people, is that to be comfortable at school and later at work. For this reason, you have to choose a major which is related to your interest; otherwise, your life might be uncomfortable or even a nightmare.  In addition, when you choose your favorite major, you will be entertained in your studies and later in work. You will not have a stressful classes or work, even if you have a lot of work in your classes or job and you stay the whole night studying or working. In contrast, you will not enjoy your studies or work and you might have a stressful time especially when you have a lot of work to do. For instance, if someoneâ€™s hobby is using computers, he will be very happy if he chooses to study computer science because this field will be enjoyable and easer for him. On the other hand, if this person chooses other major which he might not like, but the market needs it; his life will be uncomfortable and even more like a nightmare.  In addition, he will not have enough time to do his hobby.  Ultimately, he might skip classes or work which can cause him a lot of troubles.Second, if you want to be successful, you have to choose a major which you like; otherwise you will be unsuccessful if you choose a major which is only related to the market.  When you start studying at college in a major that you like, you will work very hard in this field. In addition, you will enjoy studying or working later in this field. Therefore, you will earn high grades and will get a lot of raises later in your job. On the other hand, if you choose to study in a major, which you do not like, you will not get good grades and you might even fail in some of your courses or work. Moreover, when you choose a major that you like, you will be able to devise new ideas and you might invent new things. Also, you will be more likely to expand your knowledge and get a masters or a PhD. Moreover, you will be at the peak in your work, which will make you earn a lot of money. In contrast, if you choose a major only based on the market, you will not devise new ideas and you will not be professional in your field. Ultimately, you will hate school and you will not try to expand your knowledge. In addition, you might hate your job, which leads to the poor work and poor salary. Besides all that, is the urgency of managing the time in your life. When you choose the major you like, you will be able to mange your time better because your life will be comfortable. First of all, you will finish your work faster because you are profession in the field that you study or work in. Therefore, you will have more free time. In addition, your classes or work are one of your hobbies, which will make you stay extra time with your family or your friends and will make you do other activities. Overall, everyone has to choose a major which they like and not to choose a major which the market needs, because your whole life is going to depend on this chose.  When you choose this field you are going to have a comfortable life which will make you feel the excitement in life. In addition, you will be in the flow in your studies or work which will make you devise new ideas and manage the life itinerary very well, which leads you to the peak.",,0,0,0

Most people today have less time to select, prepare and eat food than their grandparents did. Fast food is very popular because it is widely available and inexpensive. In order to maintain a healthy diet, it is necessary to choose fast food carefully, by knowing the calories and putting in your mind that a large size meal may affect your body, not your wallet. In addition, fast food meals ignore the fresh food which is important for your health.Maintaining nutritional balance is not easy with fast food as there is no control over how it is cooked. Knowing the number of calories and the amount of fat and salt in the fast food can help you decide which items are better choices. Many fast food restaurants nowadays have published the calories that their food contains to satisfy their customers. However, try to order the food which has the least calories to protect your body.The large portions also encourage overeating. I have found in this website www.goaskalice.columbia.edu  How Coca-Cola bottles became larger â€œCan you believe that in the 1950s, Coca-Cola was packaged in 6.5-ounce bottles? No one even makes those anymore. Twelve-ounce cans came next, and now you can get a super-sized soft drink at a fast food restaurant containing 42 oz. That's more than one liter! The original Coke was 81 calories. The super-sized beverage is 410 calories (it would be more, but you get lots of ice included).â€ù This shows how every thing became bigger and bigger. Be careful, donâ€™t think that super-size meals are good for you; on the contrary they are very harmful to your life.  Fast food also tends to have few fresh fruits and vegetables. Make better choices when you eat at fast food restaurants. In general eat at places that offer a variety of salads, soups, and vegetables. â€œThe only true way to achieving a healthy body is to have a healthy lifestyle. For teens, that often means exercising, eating less fast food, drinking less soda, drinking more water, and watching less television.â€ù This was said by Jennifer May, M.S., R.D., M.S. the manager of Nutrition Services in www.theDietWatch.com. In general, people must be much more careful about choosing fast food for its high content of fat, sodium, and sugar.By being aware of what you eat and paying attention to how fast food affects your health, you will live a long healthy life.

As a result, having a part-time job for students may have some effects, which are having more pocket money, the work experience, and the influences on school work.First, the biggest effect is having more pocket money which is the main reason for students to have a part-time job.  Not all students have enough money to pay their tuition or buy their materials.  Also, some of their parents may not support them all the money they need.  Their parents may not be rich or they may want their children to be independent.  Therefore, they need to find jobs to earn some money.  For instance, they may be a waiter or a waitress in a restaurant, which is the most popular place for them to earn some money.  With the money they earn, they can do anything they want.  For example, they can save it, buy textbooks, or buy their clothes.The second effect is the work experience.  For students, this is a good opportunity.  Students usually learn many strategies from their major.  However, they do not really have many opportunities to practice.  Therefore, having a part-time job is a big step.  For example, they can learn different points of view and experiences from their coworkers.  Practical training is also a good way to learn about their major.  In my opinion, working ahead before entering their work field can make students have mental and physical development.  They will become more skilled.The last part is the influence on their school work, which may be a opposite effect for having a part-time job.  After finishing their jobs, the time is usually late at night.  They might feel tired which might cause them not to be able to do their homework or concentrate in class.  If their first class is in the early morning, they may skip it.  As a result, they might fail their classes.  However, not all students who have part-time jobs fail their classes.  Some students choose their part-time jobs which is similar to their major.  They might be able to do their homework and work at the same time.Finally, students can be influenced by having a part-time job.  Learning how to earn money, how to be independent, and having more experience for students are big influences in their future.  Although some students might not be able to handle their school work and jobs at the same time.  On the other hand, if they can organize their time well, they can still earn a good grade.",,0,0,0

I think they have many good requirements for taking care of children. First, their surrounding is good. They are not wealthy, but they have enough money to take care of children. In addition, they have a house which has enough room to take care of children and they have good neighborhoods. Next, they have a way with children, because Mike works is an elementary school and Karen also used to teach in an elementary school. Finally, before everything they really love kids. Unfortunately they couldnâ€™t have their children for 12 years. I think if ever they have own children, they wonâ€™t discriminate between own children and others children. As above I think they should take care of children.2:the other people is not as good a candidate   Robert Crowley is a bad choice, even though Victor and Caroline nominate him to be guardians in first time. However Caroline Crawley desired to change the document written about nomination of guardian, because he was divorced and is unsuccessful in his job. So he might have debts now. As above I think he is not good choice.  Lydia also isnâ€™t good choice, even though Caroline was wondering if she would be willing to be childrenâ€™s guardian. However she decided to end her engagement, because she canâ€™t give up her career now. In addition, she has to travel around the world in her job. I think she must get marry at some future date. Therein before I think she is not good choice.  The Crowleyâ€™s also arenâ€™t good choice, even though the children have been staying with them since the death of their parents. However, they are elder, so they must hard work to take care of children. Because, Mr. Crowley has an experience a heart attach and Mrs. Crowley is getting worse her condition.

980,88,dm4,10032,"I think Karen and Michael are the best guardians of children for several reasons.  First, they love kids, and they are very looking forward to having children.  I believe theyâ€™ll cherish of children very much.  Second, they have a nice house and neighborhood for children.  I believe children can benefit a lot from a good neighborhood.  Third, their financial situation is doing okay, so they donâ€™t have any money problems.  Thus, they wonâ€™t misuse the fund.  Fourth, theyâ€™re all teachers, and consequently they have many experiences with young children.  Fifth, Karen realizes that she has to spend sufficient time with children, so she is willing to quit her job to take care of children.  Sixth, they are young, thus they have enough energy to take care of children.  Finally, because of the problem of getting along with Caroline, she wants to make up the problem, and I believe she will do her best to raise children in order to atone for Caroline.      In my opinion, both Carolineâ€™s parents, Ruth and Bennet, and Victorâ€™s parents, Violet and Henry are not good choices of guardians because they are too old to take care of children if they die early.  Also, when people are getting old, they may have some illnesses, such as: Mrs. Crowley has the problem of arthritis.  Even though they didnâ€™t have any problem of health, I believe they donâ€™t have enough energy to take care of children. Therefore, I think the childrenâ€™s grandparents will not be the best guardian for the children.  In addition, Victor and his parents didnâ€™t share the same values, for example, they had some very public disagreements on the construction of government housing for the poor.  Lastly, Mrs. Crowleyâ€™s religion is very important to her, however, the children are not familiar with that and their parents would not like to take them to a religious school.  To sum up, their age and healthy situation, different values and religion are the factors that they might not be the suitable guardians.    I feel Robert, Victorâ€™s brother, is not a good choice to be the guardian of the children.  There are some reasons, first of all, he is a bachelor, and I donâ€™t think he can take care of children well by himself.  Next, he is irresponsible to manage his finance, actually, he was bankrupt, so I donâ€™t think he has enough money to take care of children.  Although money is not a problem to children because their parents provide for them by the will, I still think Robert is not a good choice.  Because of his money problem, I doubt that he will use the money responsibly.  For these problems, even though he loves children and always have fun with them, he may not be able to provide a stable and secure environment to children.    I think Lydia is not a best choice to be a guardian of children for several reasons. First, I feel she is busy at work, maybe she doesnâ€™t have enough time to take care of children.  Second, visiting and raising children are very different, even though she has a very good relationship with children, she might not be good at raising them.  Third, she has to take care of children alone and she doesnâ€™t have any experience of taking care of children.  Finally, maybe the change of her life is too much to handle.",,0,0,0

986,74,fx9,10094,"The Japanese Jury System Needs More Discussions	Are you familiar with the jury system? In 2009, the jury system is going to be introduced in Japan. Actually, the system was being enforced from 1928 to 1943 in Japan. However, it was stopped operating because it took huge expenses and was not fit for Japanese people thinking that jury trials were unreliable. At present, a trial is judged by juristic professionals. In the future, however, Japanese people are partly responsible for judgment in court. Would it be possible that Japanese people could get accustomed to the system? I think Japanese government is trying to introduce it without enough considering and peopleâ€™s understanding. It might face big difficulty soon after it starts. Introducing the jury system in Japan is too early; people can be demanded a lot of knowledge and time and get psychological damage.	Lack of knowledge and attitude about law or trials can be occurred misjudging. Jurors take a responsible task judging a person, which affects the personâ€™s life directly. One of the purposes is said to reflect the social common sense into a trial, so it is assumed jurors do not need special knowledge. However, would it be really true? To judge a case, at least jurors are required understanding information and technical terms. Otherwise, the judgment could lead to misjudgment, even worse a false charge. Furthermore, jurors are needed a sober attitude and detached judgment. They are not supposed to have any prejudice. However, what if a case is a child abuse? What if they watch a TV gossip show? Would it be possible that untrained regular people do not have any prejudice or empathy? It could influence their judgment. To do all are related to judging a case, I think people need certain period of training. If so, it would be the best way that trained juristic professionals take care of trials.	The jury duty can rob jurors of their time. This duty is considered to be the responsibility of citizens that is supposed to be approved by the society. However, how would the person who is chosen as a juror and his or her company think about it? The company is not to treat a juror unfairly, but it would be true it could make the company busier to take care of extra work because the person is absent. Also, could the juror be absent from work without feeling any guilty? Moreover, can jurors get enough payment? If the person owns business and cannot enough money for the duty, it will hit his or her life directly. It might also lose customers or its reputation during temporary closing. It is possible people cannot find value in taking part in the system if they see the disadvantages. Even homemakers are not exceptions. They cannot leave early during a trial or session even if they have to pick their children up or prepare dinner. I was wondering how many people can do this duty and want to do it. If many people avoided playing a jury role because it could cause extra trouble into their lives, the jury system would merely make a trial delay and not work well.	There are some possibilities jurors could get damage mentally. They are going to deal with felony trials, so they sometimes have to read a murder report or see pictures of victims of a criminal. Ordinary people hardly ever have opportunities to do them, so I am concerned if they get trauma after they see them. If the government thinks the jury system is a duty, it should sufficiently prepare to provide mental care for jurors. I feel anxious if the government considers well about it. I believe jurors should not get serious health damage by the duty. It does not make sense if it a more harmful system than a good one.	Although this is my shrewd guess, the government is just trying to catch up with the way of G8. The seven countries except Japan have the jury system or a similar one. The government might be just concerned about the absence of it, so I guess it is trying hasty enactment. I hope my guess is wrong, though. My guess aside, I think the jury system still remains some matters to discuss. It will run into difficulty to proceed without any trouble in the near future unless Japanese government and people have full of discussions about it. Furthermore, the system did not penetrate in the Japanese society in the past because people could not believe the reliability. Could it be accepted this time? For a certainty, people will be interested in judicatory or trials after the enforcement. However, in the Cabinet Officeâ€™s survey in 2005, seventy percent of citizens said not to want to take a role of a juror. Would it work well with citizensâ€™ reluctance? Also, the present system is operating pretty well. In spite of the fine system, why is it going to be introduced now? The system is needed sufficient discussions. It is better that it will be introduced after public enough understanding. We can wait until then because we have not been caring about it for sixty years already.",,0,0,0
987,74,fg8,10095,"Making Friends on InternetWith the development of computer technology, a lot of people rely on computers increasingly to help them. For example, they get used to paying various expenses on Internet, buying various articles on it, and even making friends. Nowadays, many people, regardless of being office workers or young student generation, like to make friends by internet. Office workers think they spend most time working, so that their circles of living are too narrow. They are too busy in working to meet new friends. Furthermore, students are curious about the virtual Internet world. They think making friends on Internet is a fashion activity, so that they want to catch it up. Both of them think this different kind way of making friends is interesting. They can meet lots people who are from different cities, countries, fields, and so on. However, Internet is a virtual world. People on Internet can make up their identities. If you like to make friends on Internet, you might meet some situations, such as you might not have your wish to make the true friends on Internet, you might be defrauded, and you will addict to the Internet World. First of all, you may not make the true friends if you are interested in making friends on Internet. Internet is a virtual world. People can make up their true identities for protesting themselves, fun, or other purposes. That is impossible for you to understand a person completely and properly on Internet. You should communicate with a person for a long time, you might be able to know who he or she is, and whether you and he or she can become good friends or not. However, people on Internet can pretend themselves to be a wonderful person. They might not want to make friends with you sincerely; they might just have fun instead. They may not be a good friend that you desire. When I was a freshman of the university, making friends on Internet was quite popular among my classmates and me. We were interested in chatting with others and making friends on Internet. At that time, we made some friends on Internet. At first, we communicate with each other in the chat rooms, and by phone. But, after a period of time, we did not contact gradually due to losing the fresh interest.Besides, if you are addicted to make friends on Internet, you might be defrauded. People have different purposes to make friends on Internet. Some of them feel lonely, and some of them may want to get some benefits from others. We often hear some bad news from the TV news program. They might be people are cheated money, and even are raped by their friends who meet on Internet. At first, persons who have abnormal purposes on Internet pretend to want to be friends with you. After you trust them, they will seduce you into their traps. This issue is getting serious at present. How to prevent from crimes on Internet has become an important challenge for the public security. In addition, addicting to the internet makes people become unsociable. They just concentrate on their virtual world. They make friends on Internet instead of the real life. They do not know how to make friends, and how to communicate with others in their ordinary lives. Gradually, their behaviors will become strange. Also, they will emphasize on Internet rather than their jobs or studies if they are addicted to making friends in the chat rooms. They do not want to work, or study. Students will fail to their studies; on the other hand, the workers will lose their jobs. This situation will make them have abnormal lives. Even it would damage their health due to the abnormal lives.Making friends on Internet is a fashionable tendency. It is good for people to make different friends. You can get the information of the different fields, life and culture from these friends. However, Internet is a virtual world. You should prevent yourselves from being cheated, and even being raped. You should be careful especially when you will meet these friends. Besides, Internet is a source that you can make friends, but it is not the only way. You should not addict to it. Actually, you should strengthen your friendship and expand the circle of your life. You should concentrate on your jobs, or studies, lives, and so on. Addicting to Internet is bad for you.

Thinking about the best guardian for children should consider the ten points below: health and age, relationship, experience, stability and security, religion and culture, time, number of children, practical considerations, finances, and willingness. Choosing guardians is not easy, because you must consider a lot of aspects. However, it is the most satisfactory to choose Karen and Michael for the guardian. First, they love the two children, and I believe the children love them, too. This is the most important point. I donâ€™t think that the couple have bad relationship with the childrenâ€™s parents. At Family Court, Karen said â€œwhen he and my brother in law Victor got together they always talked about baseballâ€ù this means that they frequently got together. Although Karen was always jealous of her sister, Caroline, and they never got along very well, but these are very little problems. Because they are sisters and the blood relationship usually doesnâ€™t make big problems. I think they only had little problems and didnâ€™t have big problems. Choosing guardians is a big thing, so donâ€™t think the small problems. I feel the following opinion from Victor is not good. She said to her friend, Lydia that â€œour problem is that we canâ€™t think of any couple that we would like to nameâ€ù I donâ€™t agree with her and I think she was narrow. Their relationship was not very good, and I donâ€™t think this is all Karenâ€™s mistakes, but Karen didnâ€™t mention, just because she was gone. Karen and Michael were sane and not narrow. In the other hand, adultâ€™s relationship donâ€™t influence the relationship between adult and children, because of the blood relationship and children are harmless. Karen and Michael werenâ€™t thought about the guardians in the first place, just because they had better choice (Robert couple) and they are narrow. Second, Karen and Michael were willing to be guardians very much. Karen was very sorry for her Caroline and tried to make up to her sister for all the problems. In addition, she was willing to quit her job to take care of the two children, and they could even move their home. Third, they didnâ€™t have their own children, this is an advantage. If they have, maybe they would have some differences with the two children and their own children. Finally, they are not rich but they are doing OK. I believe they must give the two children a stable, secure and loving home.  	I think Lydia is not the best choice but she can be a good guardian. She has a lot of advantages to be a guardian and her condition accord with the standards of a guardian. So I just talk about her disadvantages for a guardian. She is a bachelor and she will make an engagement with her loving man, and no one knows if he will agree with her being a guardian. Maybe being a guardian is a problem for her marriage. But if he loves her very much, this is not a problem. Henry and Violet Crowley is a good choice for the guardians. They only have one problem, just because they are old and will have something wrong with the health. The two childrenâ€™s another grandparents, Bennet and Ruth Ames, didnâ€™t apply for the guardians, maybe they think that they arenâ€™t the best guardians, and they know clearly they have some problems for the guardian. But I believe they love the children and the children love them. Finally, Robert couple wasnâ€™t the best guardian in the first place. Because he was divorced and was forced to file for bankruptcy, so he is irresponsible.",,0,0,0

998,74,dj0,10106,"These days, many people are running for success in life. Although the result of the success is different depending on what they desire, it is definitely truth that everyone wants to feel the happiness of the success in their own ways. Actually, to succeed in life, some elements are required, such as intelligence, money, and degrees of high education. Also, some people might think that being lucky effects to succeed more than hard work. However, being lucky has nothing to do with success in life because it bothers us to concentrate fully, and depending on how much effort people make to do something, people achieve the success differently.	First of all, people need to concentrate amply when they would like to conduct their work successfully. However, while they are focusing on their work, they sometimes lose the flow, and they have difficulties to continue the work. At that time, they often think to be lucky; in other words, by being lucky, they hope to succeed in their fields more easily, earlier, and better. Some people spend much time to find the luck. For example, making assumptions and following superstitions. In fact, the behaviors do not help succeed in life virtually. This is because finding the luck makes people neglect to do their main work, so the neglect might causes to take a longer time for success in life. As a result, being lucky is one of obstacles to concentrate on main work deeply instead of getting advantages from that for success.	   Second, success depends on how much effort people make rather than whether having the luck. Some people say that it is difficult to succeed in life because they were not born with the luck. Also, they think that a person who is lucky needs to make less effort than one who is not lucky for success. However, being lucky comes from making effort, so it never happens alone; in other words, a person who is not working very hard can not have the luck. For example, when I was a high school student, I had a friend who though that she had the huge luck. Although she slept during her classes and she never does her homework, she usually easily got an A on her exam. Everyone thinks she definitely will go to one of top universities because of the huge luck. On the other hand, I tried to listen to every words from my teachers in classes, but it was not very easy to get an A. One year after I became a high school student, I chose a complex way to go to university successfully. This is that I participated in a leadership program and a musical circle besides classes to gain various kinds of knowledge. As a result, when I was in my final year in my high school, the much experience besides my classes allowed me to enter university earlier than the other students. While I was in high school, I was sometimes exhausted because many school works: studying, position as a leader, and performing musicals. However, finally, my effort which was not based on being lucky helped me enroll university earlier and better university than my friend who had huge luck.	Thinking about being lucky might help people view in positive ways because the luck could encourage them. However, the time that people spend on finding the luck is going to nothing. If the people spend the time for making effort or concentrating on their work, they will get much more advantages than getting only the luck.",,0,0,0

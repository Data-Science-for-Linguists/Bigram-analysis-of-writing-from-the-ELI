*Project title:* A comparison of written and spoken lexical bundles in the Pitt ELI corpus

*Summary:* At the University of Pittsburgh, a data set was created from the output of learners at the English Language Institute (ELI) from 2005-2012. This output was in response to speaking, writing, reading, and grammar tasks, with the resulting corpus consisting of written and transcribed speaking texts from three different proficiency levels (low-intermediate, intermediate, and advanced). The learners in this corpus primarily have three different L1s: Arabic, Chinese, and Korean.

To date, there has already been analysis of the corpus, e.g. in relation to lexical development (Juffs 2015), yet numerous avenues for research remain. The proposed project seeks to complement the current work of Juffs (2017) which analyzes lexical bundles in academic writing in the corpus. In this related project, lexical bundles of the spoken transcripts would be collected and analyzed, with a view to discovering differences and similarities to those found in the learners' academic writing.

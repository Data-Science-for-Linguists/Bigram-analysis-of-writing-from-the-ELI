*Project title:* Analysis of bigrams from learners' written work at the Pitt English Language Institute (ELI)

*Summary:* At the University of Pittsburgh, a data set was created from the output of learners at the English Language Institute (ELI) from 2005-2012. This output was in response to speaking, writing, reading, and grammar tasks, with the resulting corpus consisting of written and transcribed speaking texts from three different proficiency levels (low-intermediate, intermediate, and advanced). The learners in this corpus primarily have three different L1s: Arabic, Chinese, and Korean.

To date, there has already been analysis of the corpus, e.g. in relation to lexical development (Juffs 2015), yet numerous avenues for research remain. The proposed project seeks to complement the current work of Juffs (2017) which analyzes lexical bundles in academic writing in the corpus. In this related project, lexical bundles, specifically written bigrams, are collected and analyzed, with a view to investigating the relationship between the metric of Mutual Information (MI), learner proficiency, and bigram frequency.

MI is the strength of the association between words, i.e. the two-way likelihood of them co-occurring (Simpson-Vlach & Ellis, 2010). MI is of particular importance when considering how meaningful formulaic sequences are, as they are the statistical measure which corresponds most closely to native speaker judgements of the salience of formulaic sequences (Paquot & Granger, 2012).

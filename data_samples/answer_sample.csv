I was shocked having heard that affirmation, since my friend is a quite liberated man who is living within the XXI centuryÂ´s standpoint. For he, who is a knower of American culture, it is easier to deal with the upbringing process of a boy instead of a girl. It is unbelievable how the fact that boys are preferred over girls is still conceived. It is said that women have gained access to many standards in our society, and this fact is easily verifiable with current statistics. Nevertheless, many future parents would prefer to have a male child arguing that a boy requires less educational effort, less problems in the adolescence years and more access to job opportunities. In the next paragraphs I will disclose why many parents justify each one of these arguments and I will show how these appreciations could have a profound impact in the demographic characteristics of our society.First that all, it is appropriate to establish that the desire of many parents of having a boy is just a vague desire. It is essentially impossible to choose the sex of a child. The act of conception is a process that according to scientific knowledge is due to chance. Thus, having established this issue, we could just speculate about the results in the case that parents were able to decide the genre of their next generation. However, the perception that boys implies a better option compared with girls, deserves a wide discussion.  In general, boys are considered less expensive than girls in terms of material needs. Early in the upbringing process, girls are always demanding expensive gifts. Expensive presents, which are desired for young girls, are more complex that boy's toys, which are mostly cars and superheroes. In the same way, in the teenage years, girls insist in expensive gifts such as cosmetic items and social compromises such as parties, trips, cruises. Most of these compromises are driven by social pressures. On contrast, males are by far less demanding. A soccer ball, a baseball bat or a collection of cars, is enough to get entertained and distracted as a young kid. In the teen years, boys acquire less social compromises and demand less care in terms of sexuality and behavior.The preference for males instead of girls for many parents also is based upon facilities in the educational process. For some parents the upbringing process in girls could be challenging. Overall, girls assume a demarked role inside society. Although recently more and more young women are reaching the job market, family values and maternity are still desirable end points for each woman. However, many young women can find hard to engage with these classical values because they do consider them as inherent features of paternalist models. Furthermore, some parents consider that there is more pressure at the time of discussing sexual concerns with girls than with males. It is socially accepted nowadays the fact that women are in free to decide sexual preference and birth control methods. Having this fact in mind, many parents are afraid of this imminent discussion. Finally, despite of big efforts on improving jobs opportunities for women, there are still some limitations in job access to woman, even professional ones. This phenomenon is more remarkable in developing countries where feministic manifestations are more subtle. Thus, boys would have fewer problems when they face the challenging of accessing job markets. Surely, there are more reasons to support why some parents prefer boys instead girls. In some cultures like oriental ones, it is believed that boys are more able to support their parents when they get old. On the contrary, generally girls get married and they usually leave the familiar core. So girls are less able to support parents when they get elderly. At the end, all the reasons to support boys instead of girls converge in social or cultural fields. This fact might insinuate that most of these reasons are based mainly upon stereotypes instead of natural advantages. Demographically, the fact that more boys could surpass the number of girls is worrying. It might threaten the genetic diversity and increase the number of endogamous marriage. At least that explicit abortive maneuvers be taken against pregnant women carrying up a female fetus, it hardly would be real.

Almost all international competitions are administrated in English. For example, the Olympics worlds contest. In addition I talk about my ideas and opinions on internet discussion groups or send e-mail to interesting people and learn about their life and culture.The last reason is business. Learning English give me the ability do business oversees in other countries. Learning English helps me to open the door of business and markets over the world. All business today is international. I have to know English to contact other businesspeople. There are many international business newspapers and magazines written in English.   In conclusion, learning English is probably one of the best skills to study by the beat language and communication with people from different country and make business over the world.

Scientists are also interested in relative risks, but because of lack of available data there is no conclusion. Nevertheless, researchers turned to news reports which have headlines in such things to gather numbers in fatalities. According to study, it shows that the death rate is remained in the past decade even participation is increased, and heart problems occupied the most part of death causes. The conclusion for the study is that marathon is safe for most runners but not for people in heart problems. Another study says people who have cardiac arrests and easy affected are around age of 42. Dr. Thompson who is not only a study leader but marathon runner states that the findings enhance what we already knew.

So they often forget something and get busy to do it in a very moment and can not do it well. Sometimes, they are spending time without thinking then realize that there was something they should do. It is not just for college studentâ€™s problem but for everyone. Therefore we all should manage our time very well and do their things right, for me, there are three ways to manage time. First, I think prioritizing and doing the most important thing last is an efficient way to manage time. If you donâ€™t have orders or priorities, you canâ€™t decide which one is the most important thing to do. So, first thing to do is making your own list you should do and prioritizing in your way, and you can decide according to due dates and importance. In my case, I used to do the most important thing first and sometimes it took too long to finish so I completely forgot other things. One day I was so angry with me because I forgot many things. So, I was trying to save other things and I did every thing mixed with nervous mind. I did one thing and remained it then did the other thing, and I think it made me do poor job. Now, I make my own planner which looks like a small calendar and put everything in it such as homework. And, I make a list from the planner then I decide the most important thing and set priorities with other things. Once, I planned everything which I should do today and do easy and not important things with priorities then I do the most important thing last. In this way, I can have more time to concentrate on the important thing because other things donâ€™t bother me. Second, to manage time, planning things before doing something is a good way. Sometimes students are too busy to plan many things they should do. So, they often forget things and lose control time they have. I think they should think first and do something. To plan time, first, they should get up early and make todayâ€™s plan. Unless they have time to think, they can not use time efficiently. In my case, I sometimes got up late and ran to the school of ELI. I didnâ€™t have time to prepare classes and textbooks. For this reason, I feel time is too fast and I was frustrated. To avoid this situation, students should prepare their today. So, I made a sheet which had a time line and wrote down in a large scale then looked at it when I felt killing time. And, the other good thing about making a daily plan is that you can realize your having much time. When I did not make a daily plan, I did not know how to organize things and have dead time. Actually, my friend, Eun-Jin taught me how to make a daily plan. She made a sheet for me and got me to look at my day. At first, it was hard to organize things and write down every detail. However, I tried to make my own plan and now, I can organize things and do them better. Finally, to manage time, I think setting time limit for things is important. People often forget time while doing important thing or favorite thing. So, they can not use time efficient and have to do other thing in not enough time. As I mentioned before, prioritizing and planning a day is important, but if you donâ€™t care about time you spend, those are not quite useful for them. To make other things useful, you should decide time limitation for something they usually do. It could be doing homework, playing a game or some other things they enjoy. So, you know the appropriate time you should spend then you can prioritize them and avoid using time inappropriately. For example, I do like to play a game such as Star craft, and sometimes it makes me not to realize time. Even though I planned and prioritized things I should do, I can not have chance to do them. Therefore it is so important to decide time limitation, and I can actually use other time management skill. There are many ways to manage time but I think these three steps are crucial. First, you should make your own list and prioritize things in the list. Then, you can make a daily plan according to your prioritized things. Finally, with these two ways, you should decide time limit. As, I mentioned before in my third paragraph, it is most important to care about time you spend and use it appropriately. '",null,0,0,07826,1169,aa8,25645,"'I think it is reasonable to me because I chose a person who has good smell for me.

In addition I can use many expressions in grammar on my writing. In my country I had studied separately and did not use some expressions at all.

Then they often forget important things such as homework or quizzes and get busy to do or prepare them in a very moment and canâ€™t do them well. Sometimes, they are spending time without thinking then realize that there was something they should do. It is not just college studentâ€™s problem but everyoneâ€™s. Therefore we all should manage our time efficiently and do our things right, and Iâ€™m going to talk about three steps we can follow to plan our days and explain why each steps are important and efficient.First step to manage time is making a list. Sometimes there are so many things going on your classes and you may easily forget a certain thing. Even though you have good memory, you canâ€™t memorize everything. And that is the one thing good about making a list. The other good thing about making a list is that you can aware of everything you should do by scanning it. Of course, without a list, you can think of many things in your mind but sometimes, it can be wrong and takes long time compared to scanning a list. To make a list right, you have to carry a small note or schedule book and take notes on it to make sure you didnâ€™t miss anything you should do then categorize every detail from your note or schedule book. For example, Iâ€™m a student of ELI and Iâ€™m taking 5 classes. Each class has different homework or dates of quizzes, so I made a sheet in order to write down homework and quizzes on it and it is divided into 5 parts because I have 5 classes. Once I make the sheet, I can use it to make a list. Thus, it didnâ€™t take long time to start doing homework or preparing quizzes because I knew I wouldnâ€™t miss anything, and how many things I should do by scanning the list. Second step to manage time is prioritizing from the list. If you donâ€™t have orders or priorities, you canâ€™t decide which one is the most important thing to do. So, first thing to do is prioritizing in your way, and you can decide according to due dates and importance. In my case, I used to do the most important thing first and sometimes it took too long time to finish so I completely forgot other things. One day I was so angry with myself because I forgot many things. So, I did one thing and left it unfinished then did the other thing, and I think it made me do poor job. Now I decide everything which I should do in a day and do easy and not important things with priorities then I do the most important thing last. In this way, I can have more time to concentrate on the important thing because other things donâ€™t bother me. Final step to manage time is planning a day. Sometimes students are too busy to plan many things they should do. So, they often forget things and lose control of time they have. Unless they have plan in a day, they can not use time efficiently. In addition, they can realize they have much time to do many things. To plan time, you can divide a day into many parts, in my opinion, 3 parts are efficient to plan a day because we all have time to eat daily meal. Then you can put usual things into 3 parts such as jogging, having a QT, or taking a bus. Finally you can decide which thing in your prioritized list you made before should go in 3 parts. In my case, I sometimes get up late and run to the school of ELI. When I was late, I was easily frustrated because I didnâ€™t have time to prepare classes and textbooks. But, once I made a sheet which has 3 parts like I mentioned before and wrote down usual things, I could look at it and think about my daily plan quickly, so I could start my class with prepared mind.   There are many ways to manage time but I think these three steps are crucial. First, you should make your own list and prioritize things from the list. Then, you can make a daily plan according to your usual things and prioritized things. In this way you wouldnâ€™t miss anything, you can concentrate on the most important thing, and you can prepare your day more easily. '",null,0,0,09241,1341,aa8,26599,"'Seal pups are taken care of by their mothers until the mothers stop giving milk to them. Many mother seals travel together to get to the place of chosen area, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where they can raise their pups before they bore their babies. Seal pups are very small when they are born in few days. At first, they are coated white hairs and that help pups warm. Few weeks later, the hairs take apart from pups; we can see silvery grey coat with black spot, then the coat grow as they are growing. When they completely grow, mother seals got their pups to stop having milk from them and leave them. After mother seals leave their pups and meet male seals to mate, they go back to Greenland where they come from. Meanwhile seal pups lie together on the ice and wait until it melts. They sometimes call their mothers but get used to being without mother, then they also go to Greenland. Usually seals live for 30 yrs and they meet many dangerous creatures which want to eat them but most of all, humans are extremely harm creature for them.

So, Iâ€™d like to talk about three of them and why I was so surprised at them in my essay.  First, I was so surprised because homeless people followed others to get money. After 3 days, arriving at here, I met one homeless guy and he asked me for money so I gave 2 dollar to him. Then I walked again but he was following me and asked me for certain amount of money again. I was freaked out because I havenâ€™t seen homeless person like him before and I was alone when I met him. In my country, we can meet homeless people in the certain places such as at the entrance of subway or bus station and they are just sitting there or playing musical instruments to get money from others. Sometimes they get into a bus and sell small things with expensive cost but never follow others. Nowadays I always prepare some money to give them and when I meet them, I give it and run away. Even if it looks like ridiculous I would do that because I donâ€™t have enough money to spend.   Second, I was surprised because so many people are running everywhere. After I got used to my neighborhood and cold weather was slightly gone, I could see some people running along the load in the middle of the day and I was wondering â€œwhy are they running on the load not in a park or gym?.â€ I thought they are just few but it was very interesting for me. Then I saw there were many people running and realized that it was just about the cold weather; what I mean is they didnâ€™t run because it was cold outside. In my country, to run, we have to go special places such as park, liver side or gym and especially we donâ€™t run in the middle of the day. I think there is no reason for not running on the load in the middle of the day, we just donâ€™t do it. So, one day I tried running to get to University of Pittsburgh from my home in the middle of the day, and it took 30 minutes.

Thus, Iâ€™ve been thinking about differences between U.S and Korean public transportation because I had taken Korean buses and subway to go to my university for a long time. I think there are differences and, Iâ€™m going to explain three differences between Korean and U.S public transportation. However, there is no subway in Pittsburgh, so I want to more focus on the buses.U.S buses have auto ramps and moving down system for handicapped people, but Korean buses have no equipment for handicapped people and even have stairs. For example, people who sit on wheelchairs or elders canâ€™t get on or off the bus by themselves, so others have to help them to get on or off the bus in my country. However, unlike U.S buses move per 15 or 20 minutes, Korean buses move per 5 or 10 minutes, and there are the special lines for buses which canâ€™t be used for any other vehicles, so they are more convenient and fast for people who donâ€™t have their own vehicle. Second, Iâ€™d like to talk about pay system between U.S and Korean public transportation. U.S buses take only cash, but Korean buses take cash and we can pay with plastic cards which can be rechargeable with cash. And, there are very special about these cards. For example, we can put cards on the special equipment in the bus or subway and, the equipment can recognize the time, and if someone takes another bus or subway in one and a half hour, he or she can take the other one free. Third, I want to compare the comfort between U.S and Korean public transportation. U.S buses have excellent air-conditioner system, unlike Korean buses. When I came here it was May, but U.S buses already turn on the air-conditioner. However, Korean buses turn on the air-conditioner in July. U.S buses are clean and comfortable while theyâ€™re moving; on the other hand Korean buses are not clean and comfortable because they are old. And, Korean buses are always crowded because there are too many people who use public transportation. Iâ€™ve been compare U.S to Korean public transportation.

Thus, Iâ€™ve been thinking about differences between U.S and Korean public transportation because I had taken Korean buses and subway to go to my university for a long time. I think there are differences and, Iâ€™m going to explain three differences between U.S and Korean public transportation, focussing mostly on buses.The first difference between U.S and Korean public transportation is with regards to availability. One good thing about U.S buses is their having auto ramps and moving down system for handicapped people, but Korean buses have no equipment for handicapped people and even have stairs. For example, people who sit on wheelchairs or elders canâ€™t get on or off the bus by themselves, so others have to help them to get on or off the bus. However, unlike U.S buses, which come every 15 or 20 minutes, Korean buses come every 5 or 10 minutes, and there are the special lines for buses which canâ€™t be used for any other vehicles, so they are more convenient and fast for people who donâ€™t have their own vehicle.Second, Iâ€™d like to talk about pay system between U.S and Korean public transportation. U.S buses take only cash, but Korean buses take cash and we can pay with plastic cards which can be rechargeable with cash. And, there are very special about these cards. For example, we can put cards on the special equipment in the bus or subway and, the equipment can recognize the time, and if someone takes another bus or subway in one and a half hour, he or she can take the other one free.Third, I want to compare the comforts between U.S and Korean public transportation. U.S buses have excellent air-conditioner system, unlike Korean buses. When I came here it was May, but U.S buses already turn on the air-conditioner. However, Korean buses turn on the air-conditioner in July. Moreover, U.S buses are clean and comfortable while theyâ€™re moving; on the other hand Korean buses are not clean and comfortable because they are old. And, Korean buses are always crowded because there are too many people who use public transportation. For example, I went to Univ in Korea, I always took crowded buses and subway. Once, I took them, I felt taking a shower with dirty hot water because people were packed like tooth picks in a cup. And, the worst part is that I had to take that dirty hot shower in the early morning right after taking a real shower. Especially, I really hate moving with packed people while buses is shaking.  In short, Iâ€™ve compared U.S to Korean public transportation and, I think there are benefits to each. U.S buses offer availability to handicapped people and comforts to others, but Korean buses are more convenient for people who have to use them to go somewhere fast and on time. Most of all, I think Korean pay system is better than U.S public transportation because we donâ€™t have to prepare change every morning. But overall, U.S buses are better for me to take because I hate to take crowded and uncomfortable buses '",null,0,0,011170,1627,aa8,28308,'c',null,0,0,011171,1628,aa8,28308,'b',null,0,0,011172,1629,aa8,28308,'a',null,0,0,011173,1630,aa8,28308,'c',null,0,0,011174,1631,aa8,28308,'b',null,0,0,011175,1632,aa8,28309,'apples which I bought from Giant eagle.',null,0,0,011176,1633,aa8,28309,'bagels which Iâ€™m going to buy from Costco.',null,0,0,011177,1634,aa8,28309,'a cake that I kept in the refrigerator.',null,0,0,011178,1635,aa8,28309,'drinks which I kept in the basement.',null,0,0,011179,1636,aa8,28309,'eggs which I boiled this morning.',null,0,0,011180,1637,aa8,28309,'flowers that I planted.',null,0,0,011181,1638,aa8,28309,"'Gale, who doesnâ€™t have a car.'",null,0,0,011182,1639,aa8,28309,'ham and cheese sandwiches which I made this morning.',null,0,0,011244,1640,aa8,28332,"'The first thing Iâ€™d like to point out is that you can save your time and money to pick up your children from a day care center. If there is a day care center in your University, you donâ€™t have to hurry to pick up your children from a day care center. For example, when I worked in a lab, there were many mothers who had children. In their case, they have to finish their experiments until 4 or 5 pm because they have to go to a day care to pick up their children, and most of them can not have enough time to finish their work so they are always tired. Like time saving, you can also save the money for fuel. If there is a day care center near your work place, you can also save the money for fuel but at least, your have to drive your car and pull over some place to pick up your children.

One is to take an examination one time, which is usually taken in Korea. It has a merit to be helpful to reduce studentâ€™s stress but there is disadvantage that student have just one chance to show there studying ability has learned for one semester like 3 month. The other is to take an examination two times, which is usually taken in America. There is an advantage to give more chances for students while students are stressful being on longer final examination period. I strongly suggest that Korea need to change their final examination system to exchange one time to two times. There are several proper reasons for Korea to be changed.First, it is unreasonable to test studentsâ€™ studying achievement for one semester by only one time because students have not enough time to review all the classes fixing to the final examination time. Students are usually attending 6 to 8 classes of 3 point for one semester, totally 18 to 24 points. In case they reviewed every study right after every class, they need much time to organize all the reviews at exact final examination time because of a lot of studying amount. Furthermore it is needed to participate in many extra activities for self development and social community besides studying in campus life. If it is certain that University exist for studentsâ€™ intellectual and social development, University should help for students to show their achievement enough by giving the chances at least two times.Second, it is unreasonable to test studentsâ€™ studying achievement for one semester by only one time because students are human being. Students are not robot but human being. Humanâ€™s presentation of their ability is able to be changed by surrounding condition. Some people can be just nervous when they are exposed to specific situation such as presentation or examination considered to be important. Some other can make a mistake at that time by unknown reason. It can bear very different result even though they have enough potential and intelligence to show impressive ability. It is supposed be overcome by themselves. However, I think it is reasonable that two chances are given for better presentation of ability. Third, it is unreasonable to test studentsâ€™ studying achievement for one semester by only one time because stress can reduce to mental presentation ability. Only one chance to present their studying effort for one semester gives a large amount of stress to students in front of examination. Stress causes a lot of side effects such like obsession, nervousness and strong tension. They prevent students from taking comfortable examination and showing their ability enough. Giving two chances to take an examination should be pretty helpful students relax and give better presentation at final examination. In Korea, a lot of college students are stressful of final examination for better grade, which is believed to guarantee their future social job. High education enthusiasm are driving students to more severe competition and make worse studentsâ€™ mental health. In short term, there can be some positive consequence by intensive competition but in long term, studentsâ€™ unhealthy mental condition will cause many problems in country including stuck of development. For three reasons that I mentioned above, I strongly suggest that Korea need to change their final examination system to exchange one time to two times. It should be helpful to grow our college students as well as develop country healthy.'",null,0,0,011840,1733,aa8,30913,"'There is a story about how the sun and moon were made by a heaven ruler in my country and I like to talk about the story. Long time ago when sun and moon was made before, there was a happy family but poor. Mother of that family was widow and she was selling small rice cakes for living and she got lovely children, boy and girl. She had to climb the mountain which was near to her house to get to the city and sell small rice cakes. One day, while she was on her way to the city, she met a scary and big tiger which wanted to take her rice cakes, so she gave one to the tiger. However, she got forced to give all her rice cakes which were supposed to be sold for her living one by one. Finally, when she gave all rice cakes and there was nothing in her bag, she was eaten by the tiger. But, the tiger still felt hungry and went to her house to eat her children. After it arrived at her home, it knocked the door and faked her voice, but her children were smart enough to recognize their mother?s voice. Therefore, they sneaked out through the back door and ran away. But, the tiger figured it out, and they were chased by it. Although they were running as fast as they can, they couldn?t get away from it because they were just children, so they started praying for help to a heaven ruler, and their desperate prayer could have sent by angels. Right after the ruler heard their message, the thick rope was gotten down to the children, and they held it and went up to the heaven. When the tiger saw what just happened to them, it also prayed for the rope, and it could get one which was old and weak. While the rope was pulled by angels, the tiger was trying to get to children, but it couldn?t reach. Finally, the tiger?s rope was cut because it was old and weak, and it was dead. As soon as, children got to the heaven, they could meet the ruler. And, they had to decide whether to be the sun or moon. And, the boy decided to be the moon because the girl was afraid of the dark.

As a result of this reason, I didnâ€™t live with my parents a long time, so we didnâ€™t have enough time to enjoy our life. For example, we didnâ€™t travel to nice places; eat dinner in beautiful restaurant and go shopping together. For these reasons, I want to have enough money to enjoy a fantastic life with my parents.Second, I want to have a big house to live in. Actually, Iâ€™ve never lived in a house. When I was in China, I lived in my auntâ€™s apartment. Now in the U.S., I still live in an apartment. Apartment is not bad, but I want to change to a house to live in because houses have many benefits, such as it have many rooms, beautiful garden and enough parking places, so I want to have a big and beautiful house.Last, I want to drive a nice car. I like famous cars and I like to drive a car. I didnâ€™t drive a car when I lived in China, but I always wanted to drive a car. Now I can drive in the U.S. I just got driverâ€™s license about 1 month ago, so I need to drive carefully anytime. Later, when my driving skills to improve, I want to buy a nice and comfortable car.All these reasons for me are important. If I want to realize these reasons, I need enough money to do that. I think most people in order to realize their wishes to earn money and work hard. Then you can enjoy your fantastic lives. Also me, I want to strive for my life.'",null,0,0,010740,1544,aa9,27741,"'I have a friend who has a good character named Adam.He is my best friend who has a short black hair.I know he has a sister who is 7 years old.She is really cute.When I went to my friend's home,she always likes to tell me something that happened in her school.My friend had a big and nice dog whose furs are white and dark.He likes talk about something that happened in soccer games.He is a good soccer player.'",null,0,0,011297,1642,aa9,28622,'I can't forget the city where I grew up because I lived there for 16 years.I had good time when I was child.I had many friends who were same age with me.There had many small house where our lived.I remember she cried the day when she fall over by herself.There were many people lived in where it was not big village.I saw there had big changed when I visited to my friend in there.Now maybe there have a lot of big houses or apartments where I still remember.',null,0,0,011664,1675,aa9,29313,"'Fast food restaurants make a lot of money because most people like to buy and eat fast food.Also it has some cause that why people like fast food:it is cheaper than other food,it can save your time,and it is delicious food.    First,it is cheaper than other food.Some food like fish and steak are expensive,but fast food is cheap.Because original stuff of fast food is cheap.Anybody can buy fast food in every where.    Second,it can save your time.Other restaurant like expensive food need long time to make,but fast food is so quick.It helps people save their time for work or make money.For example,if someone has not long time for dinner,he/she can buy fast food for dinner to eat.    Finally,it is delicious food.I think most people like to eat fast food,me too.Fast food has many kind of food.For example,food like pizza,hamburger,and hot dog are all delicious food.It helps people someone can't cook by him/herself.    You can eat fast food in any places because it is popular around the world today.Also it is delicious,so people can't leave fast food.'",null,0,0,038278,4967,ab1,81113,"'       I lived with big family ,I used to live in big house  , I SPENT ALL THE TIME WITH MY FAMILY ,I USE TO have some friends     I Live in small apartment , I LIVE WITH MY HUSBAND , I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS,I'm STUDYING NOW '",null,0,0,038791,5026,ab1,82935,"'     In the last summer I visited many places, One of them is a New York City ,  I went there with my husband , First we took a tour around the city , we went to state of liberty , and  we went to empire state building ,  the views outside are amazing , also we spent time in time square , in the last day I went to shopping, I found all my favorite brands there, We couldn't stay more than five days because it is so expansive.

That was made me more reliability for my job.	The third skill for me is ability to analysis problems and solving. The first question when I have a problem is how to analysis it?

People are able to pursue high-salary job and afford to have a higher quality of their living standard. The more desire they pursue, the more pressure they might have. Before they have ability to compete with associates, they might need to work hard on their education. School live just likes a small society; therefore, pressure exists not only in wage earners, but also in students. Pressure comes from limiting budget of education fee, getting along with teachers and classmates, and achieving their self-discipline.Limiting budget is an obstacle for students and also brings pressure to students. For instance, some students they really want to study, but their parents do not have enough money to pay their education fee. Therefore, they might think about earning money by their own. And then, they will face a dilemma of choosing studying or working. In addition, if students do not have enough money to pay for their education fee, we can assume there is some problem in their family. In this kind of situation, how can students focus on schooling? Money makes students have pressure.Having a bad relationship with teachers or students is a kind of pressure to students. On the one hand, if students do not like their teachers, they might not want to pay attention to instruction or take class, because they do not want to face to their odious teachers. On the other hand, if students cannot get along with their classmates, they might not want to go to school, either. They do not have good friends to do team work, or discuss questions. Even they might be pushed out from others. Going to school becomes a kind of pressure to them.Making a goal is good for students. But if they over care about their performance or require themselves too much, it will causes giant pressure to them. To illustrate, some students want to be the top place in their class. In order to achieve this place, they make a tough goal for themselves. They always do not satisfy their performance, even though they do more than their best. In this kind of self-discipline, some students cannot bear pressure and then commit suicide. Pressure in students might not less than wage earners. How can we release those problems? Before having a baby, considering your own economy is a good method to avoid a straitened circumstance. Moreover, banks can make a program for student loan. The loan is at the lowest interest for education fee. Secondly, school let students choose their own classes and grade their teachers. Not only grading their teachers, but school also execute improvements of grading results.

They are able to pursue high-salary jobs and can afford to have a higher quality of their standards of living. Before they have an ability to compete with associates, they might need to work hard on their education. Student live is similar to a small society; therefore, pressure exists not only for wage earners, but also for students. Pressure comes from a limited budget for education, getting along with teachers and classmates, and achieving their self-discipline.A limited budget is an obstacle for students and also brings pressure to students. For instance, some students they really want to study, but their parents do not have enough money to pay their education. Therefore, they might think about earning money by themselves. If they have some part-time jobs, they might not have enough time to devote to study. On the other hand, if students do not have enough money to pay for their tuition, we can guess there are some problems in their family. For instance, their parents are divorce; they have a single parent family, or they are foundlings. In this kind of situation, how can students focus on schooling? Money makes students have more stress.Having dreadful relationships with teachers or classmates is another kind of pressure to students. First of all, if students do not like their teachers, they might not want to pay attention to instruction or take classes, because they do not want to face their odious teachers. On the other hand, if students cannot get along with their classmates, they might not want to go to school, either. Hence, these students might not have the society of classmates. To demonstrate, they do not have good friends to do team work, or to discuss questions. Even they might be pushed out from others. Going to school becomes a kind of pressure to them.Making a goal is supposed to be positive for students, but they always care too much about their performance. That causes stress to them. To illustrate, some students want to be the top in their classes. In order to achieve this target, they make a tough goal for themselves. They always dissatisfy their performance, even though they do the best at all times. For example, they want one hundred percent correct, and they cannot accept any mistake. In this kind of self-discipline, some students cannot bear pressure and even commit suicide.Pressure in students might not be less than wage earners. How can we slove those problems? Before having a baby, considering your bank balance is a method to avoid a straitened circumstance. Similarly, banks can make a program for student loans. The loan is at the lowest interest if for paying the education. Secondly, school let students choose their own classes and evaluate all of their teachers. Schools take grades on instructors seriously and improve from the grading results. The last but not the least, teachers and parents should educate children to have a positive value of their grades, and teach them to face frustrations. For instance, even though one hundred points is charming, ninety-nine points is not your fault. This grade still means you are perfect. Grades are just numbers. The most important thing is how much knowledge they learned from studying, and how many skills they already used. Furthermore, when students feel sheer frustrations, teachers and parents should use positive attitude to encourage them and teach them an optimistic thinking.'",null,0,0,08563,1331,ac3,25905,'I had never cooked by myself.',null,0,0,08564,1332,ac3,25905,'I have been studying English for a year.',null,0,0,08565,1333,ac3,25905,'she had been crying.',null,0,0,08566,1334,ac3,25905,'sands had run into her eyes.',null,0,0,08567,1335,ac3,25905,'by the time she recommonded this book to me.',null,0,0,08568,1336,ac3,25905,'when my mother called me.',null,0,0,08569,1337,ac3,25905,'I was talking with my friend.',null,0,0,08570,1338,ac3,25905,'she had left.',null,0,0,08571,1339,ac3,25905,'my friend had waiting for half hour.',null,0,0,08572,1340,ac3,25905,'he had palyed with a dog.',null,0,0,09206,1342,ac3,26586,"'I usually think about having a safe trip when my airplane takes off, so I always pray at the beginning of a trip.'",null,0,0,09207,1343,ac3,26586,'I tried out a new Apple laptop in an Apple store last Saturday.',null,0,0,09208,1344,ac3,26586,"'My agent recommended me to study in ELI at Pitt, and I found out about details of ELI from its website.'",null,0,0,09209,1345,ac3,26586,'A doctor needs to call a consultant in to make sure his medical issue.',null,0,0,09210,1346,ac3,26586,"'If you face a dilemmatic problem, it always makes you hard to work a problem out.'",null,0,0,09211,1347,ac3,26586,'Parents take dangerous things away from a child because they want to avoid an accident.',null,0,0,09212,1348,ac3,26586,'You can use google search system to look anyoneâ€™s address up online.',null,0,0,09213,1349,ac3,26586,"'When something has brought you down, you need to have an optimistic attitude first and then find out a way to solve your frustration.'",null,0,0,09214,1350,ac3,26586,"'You pick out a green, heavy and moist corn first and then tear off leaves of corn; therefore, you can make sure how the quality of corn is.'",null,0,0,09215,1351,ac3,26586,"'You need to set up all utilities, furniture, and communications, while you are moving in a new apartment.'",null,0,0,09263,1341,ac3,26610,"'As living is longer than ever before, people become harder to work.

After I came here, I have met a lot of immigrants from Korea. I got to know the reasons why people immigrate by asking to immigrants. There are 4big reasons. The first thing is a dissapointment with society of Korea. A lot of illegality and corruption have brought us down. The next is the education of children in Korea.

Even after spend an economic crisis for several years, we still have trouble with economy. People moved abroad to find job better than before. The last one is a quality of neighborhood.

However, do you really think so? Although every reasons, it is much worse to immigrate than you thought.

Therefore it's more difficult to live even in good neighborhood. I have two aunts who immigrated 10years ago. Whereas they hoped a wonderful life in the US,a reality of life is not really so.

Finally tragedy happened by Cho.  In conclusion, I want to mention about national traits. I know that most people who left Korean don't like Korea so much.

I got to know the reasons why people emigrate by asking immigrants. There are 4 big reasons; dissapointment with Korea, education in Korea, economic problems in Korea, and quality of neighborhood.  The first reason people leave Korea is the dissapointment with the Korean society. We are dissapointed with a lot of illegality and corruption in Korea. I know that and agree with that fact. However, the person who complains about own country complains about every country. I saw many emigrants who always complain about illegality in US. And, we have to have a kind of responsibility for our nation. We need do something for our nation not just leave without any responsibility. The next is the education of children in Korea. Because a korean educational system is so changable, many students have a rough time of it. And if children go to the US, they can learn English so easily. It takes some risks. It can be confusing for children. Because they are still young, they can be confused about themselves between US and Korea. In addition, their confidence could be weaken because they can't communicate well. It's especially  dangerous for children. We can see in case of Cho Sung Hee. The third is about employment and economic problems. Even after struggling economically for several years, we still have troubles with the economy. People moved abroad to find job better than before. However, even if they have a huge hope about US, it's not really as good as they thought. Because foreign country is not own country, it's hard to adjust and settle down well. Though some body had a great job in Korea, it cannot help going through hardships.

Many cars are running very fast, sounding the horn. It looks like that someone would give a prize if the cars drive the fastest on the road. The people never yield and even smile. The police officers and the drivers on the street are so busy, they are not themselves.Before I came to Pittsburgh, I used to drive my car and take a bus in Korea. Then, arriving to Pittsburgh, though I had taken a bus before I got a driver license, I got a Pennsylvania driver license and became be able to drive here as well. Therefore, I've experienced both area; Pittsburgh and Seoul. There is no analogy between two cities but some differences: transportations, the style of drive and some emerging social problems.	Wherever people live, they should take a bus or subway, before they come to be able to drive a car. In Korea, many usually take a bus or subway. It is not only fast but economical. Although Seoul is several times as larger than Pittsburgh, the subway takes people everywhere they want to in Seoul. For Bus, there is the road only for buses on center of the road. Whereas most private cars get stuck in the much traffic, buses can run much faster than the cars. Moreover, if people want to take one of them, most transportations run every less than 10minutes. On the contrary, Pittsburgh is a little bit different from Seoul. There are the subway lines just in some area not everywhere in Pittsburgh. It is said that only a third of Pittsburgh areas have a subway lines. Also, few buses run in Pittsburgh except the area of downtown and Oakland. Most people who drive a car in the morning have many complains about that and rather choose to drive. The cost of the transportations is also not that low, so if they are not Pitt student or someone who is able to use them for free, they should spend lots of money on the transportation.	Second, the style of driving in two cities is totally different. Seoul, the capital city of Korea, is very busy and traffic is also too busy. However, the drivers drive so fast and roughly. It is said that Seoul is more crowded than New York. In downtown Seoul, the sound of horn is endless, so it is even not really easy to stay outside long time. People in Seoul (big city) tend to be rash and in hurry. Because every driver drives too fast and rough, slow drivers cannot drive in Seoul and they drive with reluctance. Police officers sometimes block streets to catch people who drunk. Given the control, many people try not to drink before they drive. However, many people still die by DUI or car accident. The death related car constitutes majority of death in Korea. Korean government must think up an innovative regulation for the death by car. On the contrary, however, most drivers in Pittsburgh are so calm and gentle that people rarely sound horn unless they are in big danger. Also they are willing to yield each other and that impress some foreigners like Koreans. If a person sounds horn loudly, the person must feel guilty of that. Many Asians are surprised to drive and cannot get used to the gentle drivers. Even people who were not able to drive in Korea because it is too busy are able to drive very well in Pittsburgh. On the other hand, people who used to drive just in Pittsburgh are not able to drive in Seoul or have an accident because it is not easy to drive any more.	Third, there are many different social problems between two cities. Two big problems in Korea are Parking spaces and the expensive gas. One fifth of whole Koreans live in Seoul which is the capital of Korea and most family has at least one car. Parking fee is so expensive and even people struggle against their neighbors for parking space. It is funny that they fight each other for parking space but it's a big problem in Seoul. Some neighbors even use their public park as parking space. Seoul citizen have to give up their precious place for car parking. Also, the gas which is another problem in Korea is so expensive. The cost of the gas in Korea is twice as expensive as that of the gas in the USA. That's why Korean people say ""Gas is Gold in Korea."" For car, Korean government should fix infrastructure of these problems. However, it is good that Pittsburgh doesn't have to worry about these problems thanks to the US government and big area of nation.	In conclusion, there are several differences between traffic in Seoul and in Pittsburgh. For transportation, Seoul is better than Pittsburgh because Seoul is a huge city and people like a speed. However, for other things, namely, the style of drive and some emerging social problems, Pittsburgh is much better than Seoul. So, Korean should learn about gentle driving etiquette from Pittsburgh, and Pittsburgh should learn about good system of transportation from Seoul. If so, both must become great city about traffic.'",null,0,0,016761,2341,ac5,37826,"'Yes, it is a good analogy because both take a time to learn and hard to learn.'",null,0,0,016762,2342,ac5,37826,'I feel so evertime I write something in English.

Truly, a marriage makes people happy and has them have a great family. However, If once people get divorced, the situation changes. A family gets hurt seriously by a divorce. In 1970's a divorce boomed that the rate doubled in the U.S. Divorce is serious problem not only in the U.S but in other nations including S. Korea.	Parents choose divorce for their better life and many of divorced people live better life after that. However, for children it is exact disaster to see that their parents get divorced. The children in divorced families have several severe problems on them namely, emotional problems, early sexual experimenting, dropping out of school, delinquency, teen pregnancy, and drug use and so on. If so, why do many people get divorced even though it hurts their children seriously? There are diverse reasons for divorce: lack of love and trust, financial problem, differences between a couple and social change.	First, even though people get married each other, they usually lack love and trust. It is absolutely true that these two things are crucial for a healthy family. There is a program on Television entitled 'Cheetahs'. In this TV program, spouses ask staffs to expose their spouse's liaison. While this program is real and very exciting, it is very sad as well. The spouses don't have any trust and love, so one of them asks the program to make another one feel ashamed. Also, one goes out with another woman or man, not one's spouse because the person doesn't love his spouse any more. As the program shows us, most people get divorced because they do not trust and love each other anymore. Therefore, for most divorced couples, lack of love and trust is one of the most important to get divorced.	Second, another reason for divorce is a financial problem. Money is necessary to keep a family healthy. Though money is not everything in life, it is said to be an integral part of life. There is a sentence ""Marriage is not a romance but real."" A married couple had spent great time until a disaster that the husband got fired came to the family all of sudden. Due to the incident, the wife started complaining and being disappointed with her husband, so they struggled much more often than before. They still loved each other but the life became hard and the relationship between them is not like before. Seriously, many couples get divorced due to the economic problem. These days, in fact, many women care about not only men's ability but also their wealth before getting married. There are some companies which introduce people who want to marry. Before people sign up the company, they should give all their information of them. The companies expect them to give them information which is their looking, education, background, job, annual salary. Good annual salary means a popular person among the people. In short, wealth became very important part of marriage.	Third, people get divorced out of a difference of personality which is selfish. Even though couples have known each other before getting married, it is not really enough to know each other perfectly. People can notice spouse's every aspect including great ones and awful ones. Also, it is so natural that they might have totally different personality because they have not lived together for decades. Unless they make a concession or understand spouse, it must make some troubles between them of course. For instance, a couple years ago, one married couple got divorced. The reason why they got divorced was that they have a different style of using restroom. Whereas the wife prefers to close the cap of toothpaste, the husband prefers to leave open the cap of toothpaste after brushing teeth. It is impossible reason for divorce, however, they did just because they could not understand each other and stand each other's differences. Not even only for this, married couple cannot help seeing spouse' real character by living together. For this reason, old people tend to say that people should know so deeply about their spouse to-be before getting married.	Last, a change of society has caused divorce. As time passes, people like to claim themselves and be selfish. Especially, for women, since 19Century, a lot of social movements for women's right have emerged. The crusaders think that individual happiness is far more important than any other things such as family and children. Many women have chosen divorce for individual happiness than their family and children with the movements. To ask individual's happiness too much leads a family to bad of course. For instance, it was natural that if the oldest son gets married, he usually takes care of his parents by living together. However, if the wife had disagreed against the fact with selfishness, the family must have had some troubles among them.  Like this, the change that people comes to claim only their rights and be more selfish causes divorce as well.	In conclusion, there are many reasons for divorce which are pretty reasonable or not. Whatever the reason is, however, people should remind this. Once people marry, the person is not only the one but the member of a family who must be responsible for the family. As people already know, divorce has a terrible effect on the children's life. If so, the people cannot decide to get divorced easily for the sake of the lovely children, or they might think at least one more. Did you love your husband? Do you love your child?'",null,0,0,017772,2451,ac5,38665,'capricious; whimsical.',null,0,0,017773,2452,ac5,38665,"'contain, include consist of sth,'",null,0,0,017774,2453,ac5,38665,'to agree to do sth',null,0,0,017775,2454,ac5,38665,'',null,0,0,017776,2455,ac5,38665,'',null,0,0,017777,2456,ac5,38665,'',null,0,0,017778,2457,ac5,38665,'',null,0,0,017779,2458,ac5,38665,'',null,0,0,017780,2459,ac5,38665,'',null,0,0,017781,2460,ac5,38665,'',null,0,0,017782,2451,ac5,38688,'capricious; whimsical.',null,0,0,017783,2452,ac5,38688,"'contain, include consist of sth,'",null,0,0,017784,2453,ac5,38688,'to agree to do sth',null,0,0,017785,2454,ac5,38688,"'the sphere of any subject, the area of interest'",null,0,0,017786,2455,ac5,38688,"'to get rid of , exclude'",null,0,0,017787,2456,ac5,38688,'to destroy or be destroyed gradually',null,0,0,017788,2457,ac5,38688,"' the opinions, beliefs and way of thinking'",null,0,0,017789,2458,ac5,38688,"'deduce, conclude with the fact which is not proven completely'",null,0,0,017790,2459,ac5,38688,"'to strenghten , emphasize'",null,0,0,017791,2460,ac5,38688,'to disregard or break',null,0,0,018144,2497,ac5,39121,"'Dear Mr. Pullman.Hello, This is JunHee Lee, who is one of the ELI students in Pitt.

His dad , who already quit the serve about 20years ago, are so sad as well because he knows what the army is. Does army that makes people sad  deserve it much? In fact, there are some awful aspects and disadvantage of it, namely, wasting time, hurting men's body and spirit and separating from lovely people.	In Korea, for most men it is mandatory to serve in army, navy or air force approximately for 2years. Since the government wants healthy people for army, many of them go into the army when they are very young like 20 or 21. During the beginning of 20's people prepare a lot of things for the future like studying, health, going through many hardship. On account of the government, men are called to army at that young age.

For example, there are sill much violence in army, so people hurt easily during the period. Even in 21century, a physical violence still exists.  The government is not willing to notice everything in army though, many severe accidents including killing people are shown on the News. Also,  some people finishing the service might not adjust to society on account of fear out of an army. They might live forever with the fear which is from army. 	Last, to get into an army, they must be separated from their lovely people.

The pressures of being an international student give you a good or bad effect but most of those who are the international students unfortunately feel serious pressures from their financials, some examinations and other people in the foreign country, especially the U.S.First, you have to get enough money to go to the U.S. For instance, you have to think and calculate how much money you will need in the U.S. and you must earn the money as much as you can before going there. Moreover, you also should estimate how at least much money you can spend a day, a week or a month during living in the U.S. and consider which of categories is the most important for your daily life, foods, transports, clothes, living or text books though you have not experienced the life in the U.S yet. Therefore, it will bother you when you save or use money in the U.S.Second, some examinations annoy you before and during being the international student. You are student in the U.S. and take some examinations such as placement tests, quizzes, final examinations of your courses. Eventually, you must study very much in order to get high grades in your courses. In addition, you will probably take other examinations of some qualifications such as the TOEFL and the GMAT, after graduating from university or finishing some programs. After all, you are always thinking about the preparation for, schedule and results of exams.Third, you feel some pressures from other people too. At first, your teachers actually give you a lot of homework, make you prepare for some projects, ask you some questions and make you write some papers in the classes. Your classmates sometimes could be your competitions in your classes and also give you a sense of jealousy. If you live in a host family, they might be worried about you so much that you will get nervous, scared for them and then dislike them or that they will impose you how you their ways of living in the U.S. In short, whoever is around you is likely to trouble you.In conclusion, financial problems before going to the U.S or during living there, some examinations you must or might take, and people who are around you will be  some factors of seriousness while you are the international student in the U.S. as I mentioned above. It is crucial experience for you to be the international student. However, there have been more effective methods to solve the problems than before. We can find many scholarships to support you now and can visit counseling institutes like a hospital and facilities to study well and can also ask persons who can advise your study in the schools and universities. Never solve the problem by yourself or escape from the difficulty you are feeling. You can change the stress into good motivation to success your life.'",null,0,0,020794,2783,ac7,47556,"'A pp125: writing an Essay of Comparison and Contrast: Block MethodPrewritingMain Topic: I prefer to live in Hong Kong more than Tokyo.Introduction: 1.	background: I have lived in both Tokyo and Hong Kong.2.	education, transportation and time3.

I know there are several similarities and differences in both cities, but I prefer to live in Hong Kong more than Tokyo.	Firstly, it seems clear that Tokyo and Hong Kong have a lot in common. Both have a lot of schools as kindergartens, elementary schools, junior high schools, high schools and universities. If you want to attend or you let your children go, you have many choices to attend schools. Secondly, transportations have developed in both Tokyo and Hong Kong. For example, you can get on taxis, buses, trains, subways from the airport to the city in both. Also you can use the transportation in cities. It is very good methods to move. Thirdly, both have a lot of holidays. You can enjoy your travel and yourself with using holidays.	On the other hand, there are some different factors in both Tokyo and Hong Kong. Firstly, English is not spoken in Japan though Japanese people had leant English when they were students. If you cannot speak in Japanese, it is crucial problem for you to live in Japan. Japan is one of countries which only the native language is spoken in. However, English, Chinese, Cantonese are spoken in Hong Kong. In addition, universities in Hong Kong have various and very famous professors because English is spoken during their classes. Not only universities offer these languages, but also kindergartens, elementary schools, and high schools do so. Secondly, though there are many taxis, buses, trains and subways in Japan, fee of them are unfortunately more expensive than ones of Hong Kong. It costs twice fee of Hong Kong when you get on a tax in Japan for as same distance as in Hong Kong and another Fees are also more expensive in Japan. Moreover, working hours of time of these vehicles in Japan are shorter than these of Hong Kong. While it is from 5:00a.m to 1:00 a.m. in Japan, it is from 5:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. Finally, the most amazing thing is the system of calendar. It is different between Japan and Hong Kong. Hong Kong's calendar has both the western calendar and the lunar calendar, so the people who are living in Hong Kong can take more holidays than in Japan. For instance, there are the new year holiday and the Chinese lunar new year a year in Hong Kong. That is, you can take new year holidays twice a year. 	In conclusion, after considering some similarities and differences between Japan and Hong Kong, I could make my decision to live in Hong Kong. That is because Hong Kong has the possibility to learn more languages and to meet many teachers and professors who are from various countries, Hong Kong's transportation has also more available time and lower fee rather than Japan and I can take more public holidays in Hong Kong than in Japan. At last, I would be satisfied with my decision to live in Hong Kong in the future.'",null,0,0,020972,2790,ac7,47897,"'There are both good things and bad things about my apartment.

Whenever I lose it, I buy new and cheap one but there are a lot of umbrellas in my house or my office. The problem I have in my everyday life is how I do not need to buy the umbrella when I lost or left it somewhere. Buying new umbrellas causes me to cost much money and to need some spaces to put in my house and my office. What will you do when you lose your umbrella? The three most effective solutions to this careless problem are checking the lost and found office in the place where you lost the umbrella if possible, writing your name and address on it, and taking it with you always. The first solution, asking the lost and found office is an immediate treatment. For example, the University of Pittsburgh has the police department. If you lose not only your umbrella but also your jacket, wallet and notebook in the campus or the class room at the university, you can ask the staff of the department by calling or by sending your email. According to the UPPD (University of Pittsburgh Police Department), ""Our department is the central location for lost and found. All property turned in to our department is inventoried and the owner is contacted if possible. Because storage space is limited, the department disposes of all unclaimed property every six months. At the time of such disposal, it is published in the Pitt News."" The lost and found office ensures your belongings. The second safe solution, writing your personal information in your umbrella is the proper method for others to contact you. When someone finds your umbrella with your name and either your telephone number or your address, he or she is able to call you or to ask the police to contact you. In addition, you might find it in case that there is not the lost and found office. The final solution is to take the umbrella with you always. You can keep your umbrella anytime and anywhere when you have a plastic bag to put it in. Moreover, your hands are free when you have a big bag to put your umbrella in or your umbrella has something like a holder to attach you. In my conclusion, there are three reliable methods to solve the problem.REFERENCEUnited States. University of Pittsburgh Police Department.

In order to protect those animals, two approaches are more effective and practical. The first approach to save endangered species is to save an area of nature as much as you can. The human being has coexisted with animals since the human being was born in the earth but the human being has being ignored the nature where  giant pandas, tigers, rhinos, elephants and great apes live for the sake of more convenient our lives such as constructing many roads, bridges and railroads. Many woods in mountains were cut because of golf resorts and huge areas of the nature are used as a farm to product vegetables. However, we should use the areas not horizontally but vertically. This method can save mountains and forests. The second approach is to reduce garbage. Especially, artificial garbage such as plastic bags, aluminum cans and batteries produce air, environmental and water pollutions when they are disposed. The garbage disposals directly threaten the lives of polar bears, whales, dolphins, and marine turtles. When you go shopping you use your own bags for shopping not plastic bags of shops or stores as much as you can. Therefore, the two methods we can practice now are to save nature and to reduce garbage.ReferenceWorld Wildlife Fund: http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/index.html, accessed on Feb.7th, 2009 '",null,0,0,023103,3016,ac7,53899,"'Considering the category of personality types on page181, Focus on grammar 5, I suppose that one personality category is closer to my personality.

Moreover, stereotypes can be based on our perspectives on others.Without objectivity or neutrality, a useful generalization about other people would become a harmful stereotype.

When international students study in foreign countries, they require permission of working there to universities, but most universities do not allow them to work. In my essay, foreign students should be allowed to work in the country they are studying in.First, it is hard and unexpected for international students to make and prepare financial plan in a country to study before they go there and during staying there. Most of international students spend time to prepare for academic documents such as, admission forms, a study plan, a CV, some academic papers, documents of visa, to enter foreign universities before they go to foreign country. Though they get permission of entering the universities, if they do not have enough money, they cannot go there. Thus, financial problem deprives them form a opportunity to study abroad. Even if they have not much money to live there and then they have permission of working in the foreign country, they are willing to apply for the universities. In fact, universities earn money from international students more than the local students by means of apply fees, insurance fees, test fees and dormitory fees.Second, working in a country to study gives international students opportunity of career experience and of improving the local language or English. Working experience is very effective for students when they find a job after graduating from a university. Some companies require international students for skill of language and careers of job. When international students have both of them, they get job both in their native countries and a foreign country. Therefore, working in a foreign country strengthens their CV after graduating from university.International students can expand their relationship to either academic friends or social friends.Counter argumentThough some international students do not work in a country to study, they complain that they do not have as same opportunity as the local students. International students always complain that they cannot hung out outside, visit some museums which require entrance fee and eat lunch or dinner in restaurants because they do not have enough money.'",null,0,0,023672,3064,ac7,56451,"'""I am busy."" we have heard this sentence in each language in the world since industrialization rapidly progressed. Most people feel everyday is busy and they say ""I am tired and have stress."" No matter how small stress you feel is, the stress is always chasing you and does not disappear. In addition, there are some types of stress you feel such as physical stress, mental stress, and relationship stress. In this essay, in order to know the cause of stress I focus on that stress basically comes from internal and external problems.First, internal problems cause stress on your body. Sickness not only damages your body and mind but also changes your daily life. For example, when you are hospitalized, you cannot work in your office, use your computer, exercise, and eat your favorite foods, especially hamburgers, pizzas, and French fried redundant. For another example, when your leg is wounded, it is hard to get on a bus, a train, or subway. Otherwise, you have to walk to your office and school for a long time or you ask your friends to pick you up in their cars every time you go out. That is, it takes a longer time for you to do anything if you are injured or get sick. Sickness burdens both your body and your life with stress.Second, external problems such as schools and work promote your stress. When your teacher gives you homework more than you expected, your motivation to do homework decreases. When your boss suddenly forces you to do things which the boss should deal with, you get frustrated with them. Though you keep your car under the traffic regulation, if others violate the rule and cause your inconvenience, you will get angry or worried. When something which you are not able to cope with and situations which you cannot expect happen to you, you feel easily nervous, worried, embarrassed and annoyed.  As a result, external problems stimulate and increase your stress very much. Third, relationship problems are also external problems and bring about stress, especially those with your family and friends. Your friends and family give you stress even if you do not have any stress. When your friends move another country or pass away, your sorrow and grief make you nervous. Your friends sometimes prevent you from concentrating on your study when they ask you some questions and chat with you. Also, if you and your friends study to pass the TOEFL test and they get the high score on the test except you, you contradictorily feel that you should get the high score too at the same time you congratulate their scores on the test and are worried whether your way to study the test is appropriate or not. Your family also annoys you sometimes. Therefore, the stress occurs to you by the people concerned with you. In conclusion, stress is inevitable problem in your life. You should understand which problem your stress is based on in order to find an appropriate solution. The most important thing is that the internal problem certainly has the potential of causing the external problem and vice versa. Hence, you should keep stress from increasing in your pace.'",null,0,0,022680,2981,ac8,52715,"'My Room   My bedroom is a nice room . like any room in myhouse, but it is little bid different .

For example in my own language the pronunciation of a word is the same of the spelling of it, while in english you can have a different pronounce for words that have the same spelling. Another important difference is that the verbs in english are easier than italian verbs, you have one only word  for the present, one for the past, one for the past participle?; the same thing happens with the articles.

In addition in Italy we have a nice weather, while in England or Scandinavia the weather is not sunny like in my country, but it's too cold and foggy. Another important difference is about policy: in Italy there is a lot of corruption, too many parties and too much confusion. Politicians take care only about their personal interests, without solving people's problems and corrupting also the economy, that actually doesn't grow. On the other hand in Northern Europe the policy is more serious, the corruption is punished by law, and their economy is better than our.However, it's also possible to find some similarities. For example for the public and social life of both the cultures, sport has a very big importance, especially soccer. In addition, we can notice by some statistics that depression is a big problem for the two areas, with a large diffusion of alcohol and a strong use of violence between people ( especially between poor people and immigrants). Third, I think that in Italy Catholic religion is very important for the social and political life of people, while Protestant religion has the same importance for people's life in Northern Europe (except for some countries, like Ireland, that is in major part catholic).

There  are  different  opinions  about  this  tendency, some  people  think  that  is  a  good  choice, while  others  say  that  probably  this  is  a  way  to  loose  time  in  our  studies. In  my  opinion, and  for  that  it  has  been  my  experience, I  think  that  is  a  good  idea. It's  obvious  that  there  are  many  disadvantages  in  this  kind  of  choice, but  probably  the  advantages  are  much  more. First  of  all, it's  very  important  for  young  people, especially  when  they  are  students  at  the  university, to  practice  different  experiences. This  means  that  sometimes  studying  on  books  is  not  enough, in  people's  cultural  formation  get  a  job  could  be  a  way  to  appreciate  more  the study, but  also  to  test  us  in  a  different  activity. Doing  this  we  could  be  more  prepared  in  future, especially  in  facing  life's  difficulties  when  it  will  be  necessary. In  addition, having  the  possibility  to  earn  money  by  their  own  capacities  is  really  a  good  thing. This  means  that  students  have  a  big  sense  of  responsibility, they don't  want  to  be  supported  only  by  their  parents, but  trying  to  be  more  indipendent. In  this  way  they  have  the  possibility  to  acquire  new  and  important  tasks, to  learn  what  does  it  mean  being  totally  indipendent  from  their  family, but  also  to  be  prepared  when  they  won't  have  the  support  of  their  parents  anymore. In  conclusion, I'm  in  favor  of  this  kind  of  choices. Young  generations  and  students  are  the  future of  our  society  and  countries, so  they  have  to  demonstrate  more  than  others  to  be  mature  people.

According to Joseph Stiglitz, an economist and winner of the Nobel Prize,"" Globalization is the closer integration of the countries and peoples of the world brought about by the enormous reduction of costs of transportation and communication, and the breaking down of artificial barriers to the flows of goods, services, capital, knowledge, and people across borders."" (Joseph Stiglitz, P1) the effects of the breaking down of the barriers have influenced Saudi Arabia in many ways.One major effect of globalization in Saudi Arabia is education. If we look at the education in Saudi Arabia in the past and compare it with the education in these days, we will see a huge different. In the early of 1960s the numbers of females who registered in a school was too low, but today there is extremely different. For example, the number of female students has increased dramatically from 25% in 60s to 47.5 in 2000 (Amani Hamdan 2005). Also globalization has led to the increase in the number of Saudi's students who study overseas. The ministry of high education in Saudi Arabia made many agreements with different countries such as the USA, the UK, Canada and Australia to send many students from Saudi to these countries to study in various subjects. In addition, the GOTEVOT (general organization of technical and vocational training) has adopted the Australian curriculum in their schools, which could help the GOTEVOT students to get a high quality of education. Furthermore, the government of Saudi Arabia has spent a lot of money since 80s to improve the education by building many schools, colleges and universities. Moreover, the government encourages students in the university by giving them payment each month to help the students during their study life.  Moreover, Saudis have been influenced by the way westerners dress up for example Saudi men used to only wear the Thoube ?traditional Saudi white shirt/robe-, and Saudi women were used to wear the Jallabiya ""traditional Saudi dress"". Because of the effect of globalization along with the influence of foreigners on Saudis, clothes like t-shirts, pants and jeans became a common clothing outfit. Nowadays women traditional outfit only used  in special occasions and the shops that sells these traditional dresses located only in the down town old boutiques and in expensive prices compared to the casual outfit. Globalization not only changed the way how people dressed up it's also changed the way of eating.In the past from the early of 1980s, people in Saudi Arabia used to eat and cock a traditional food. For instance, people prefer eating traditional food such as Kabsa "" steam rice with chicken or beaf"" and Margog ""vegetable soup that's tomato based and consist of some whole wheat dough that's wet and it pat out into small pancake type patties and and it put into the boiling vegetable soup"" than eating from a restaurant. However, this trend of eating habits in Saudi Arabia had changed at the middle 1990s. By 2000 it became common to see many fast food restaurants like MacDonald, KFC, Burger King and Pizza Hut. Therefore, people in Saudi Arabia started to change their eating habits by eating in these restaurants, although the fast food restaurants could cause some harms for our health. The reason for that is that people in Saudi Arabia travels overseas for studying or tourism each year, when they come back to their country their eating habits would be changed. Now days, people in Saudi Arabia is trying to copy not only the modern life from the western but also they are trying to copy their food habits.In conclusion, without doubt globalization had led to some benefits in the lifestyle of Saudi Arabia. In spite of the fact that globalization has some negatives one of them is globalization of values and ethics, there are many benefits for globalization. For example, the positive effects for globalization in Saudi Arabia are more than the negative effects. In my opinion, if Saudi Arabia became one of the developed countries, one of the possible reasons for that would be the effects of globalization.References: -Amani hamdan .

Living in a countryside means living in an area that is not crowded with people or cars or buses all of which pollute the air and have a direct effect on people health.       While many people claim that by living in city you have the opportunity to access schools, universities and shopping malls easer, people in a countryside having the chance to enjoy the beautiful views around them which the people in the city can not do. Moreover they defiantly have less stressful life than the people who live in the city.       People argue that people living in the city have the chance to build relationships with that elite powerful wealthy rich people, which can help them later in making business or having the chance to get the job that they are looking for. I believe that people living in the countryside not only more independent and hard worker ,but also have a better communication skills that people living in the countryside. Furthermore, they have a stronger relationships with their family and the people they love since they don't have that type of busy live other people have.'",null,0,0,046329,5905,ad4,96422,"'        There are many similarities in the two articles.

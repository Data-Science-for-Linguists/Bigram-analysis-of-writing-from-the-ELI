#### Initial License ####  
Initially, the ELI dataset will remain private and belongs to the University of Pittsburgh (managed by Dr Alan Juffs and Dr Na-Rae Han).  This privacy needs to be maintained for now given that the data contains personal information of students, including names. However, once the data has been cleaned and is ready to be utilized, the intention is of the data to become semi-open (see below).

#### Upcoming License ####
Once the data is ready to be released (see above), a new license will be created so that the data may be used publicly. After consulting with Dr Alan Juffs, it is his intention to institute a license similar to the one used by another University of Pittsburgh project, talkbank.org. This Creative Commons license, is a Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) license. In brief, it allows the following:

- Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
- Adapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material

Under the following terms:

- Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
- NonCommercial — You may not use the material for commercial purposes.
- ShareAlike — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.
- No additional restrictions — You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.

    "This new document has been created as a number of significant changes have been made to the original code. Based on discussions with other members of the ELI Data Mining Group, the following points were determined:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the sake of efficiency, it is better not to merge the different data frames into one big one\n",
    "- A 'sanitization' step of the data was completed which duplicated some of the steps of my initial code. These duplications include removing unwanted apostrophes, changing all 'null' and 'ull' to NaN, and removing empty or unreal students (who were most likely teachers). As such, the dataset is now ready for more in-depth cleaning and analysis, i.e. the purpose of this notebook. The code for the sanitization step is in a private repository of the ELI Data Mining Groups 'convert_0_to_1.ipynb'."

    "This notebook will continue to be updated until the project is ready, at which point a sample of raw data, e.g. a CSV of 1000 answers, will be included in the repository to allow for testing and reproducibility by others of the code. The exact method for sampling will be determined once the initial code is complete, as it is necessary to first have cleaner data before it can be sampled; at present, sampling results in errors due to false students, entries, etc. which can not be linked to the appropriate CSV files.\n",
